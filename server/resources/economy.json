               "text": " HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam’s government said on Sunday its economy grew at an annual rate of 8.22% in the third quarter, when a 20% tariff on U.S. imports of its products took effect, accelerating from growth of 7.96% in the second quarter. \n”It is the highest quarterly growth since 2011, excluding the surge in 2022 due to recovery post COVID-19 pandemic,” the government statement said, citing Finance Minister Nguyen Van Thang. \nSunday’s economic release did not include trade data, a key variable as a 20% U.S. import tariff on most Vietnamese goods imposed by the Trump administration took effect on August 7, mid-way through the quarter. \nThe National Statistics Office is expected to release a full set of economic data, including trade figures, on Monday. \nPrime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said last month Vietnam expected exports to grow more than 12% this year, following a United Nations Development Programme report saying that U.S. duties risked slashing by up to one-fifth of Vietnam’s exports to the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in Southeast Asia. \nVietnam would continue trade negotiations with the United States, the government and its trade ministry have said. \nThe third quarter was also marked by severe weather disruptions, with eight storms hitting the country, including Typhoon Bualoi, which caused an estimated 16.5 trillion dong ($625.5 million) in damage. \nOver the first nine months of the year, GDP grew 7.84% compared to the same period in 2024, according to the government. \nVietnam is targeting gross domestic product growth of 8.3%-8.5% this year. That is faster than last year’s 7.09% growth, and higher than the World Bank’s forecast of 6.6% and the International Monetary Fund’s estimate of 6.5% growth. \nThe country’s 2025 growth faces headwinds from external economic pressures, slow-moving reforms and escalating natural disasters, which are expected to worsen in the final months of the year, the government statement added. \nConsumer prices rose 3.27% year-on-year in the January-September period, with September inflation at 3.38%, it said. \n($1 = 26,380.0000 dong) \n(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen; Editing by Jamie Freed and Lincoln Feast.)",

His nomination was widely seen as a gesture to the left ahead of further delicate cross-party budget negotiations. \nBudget talks have grown increasingly fraught, requiring delicate trade-offs between three ideologically opposed blocs - Macron’s ruling centrist minority, the far right and the left. \nBUDGET CRISIS \nLecornu’s two predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were brought down by parliament over efforts to rein in France’s public spending at a time when ratings agencies and investors are closely watching the country’s deficit, the largest in the euro zone. \n”This is Bayrou’s government without Bayrou, and will implement the same policies,” hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel told BFM TV. \nFormer finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who oversaw France’s ”whatever it costs” response to the COVID pandemic, was appointed defence minister. He will now shape French thinking on how Europe should bolster European security as U.S. President Donald Trump demands the European Union do more to support Ukraine. \n”The choice of this identical government, seasoned with the man who bankrupted France, is pathetic,” far-right leader Marine Le Pen said on X, referring to France’s surging deficit during Le Maire’s tenure at the finance ministry. ”We are utterly dismayed.” \nSeveral key ministers remained in their post, including Jean-Noel Barrot at the foreign ministry, Bruno Retailleau at the interior ministry and Gerald Darmanin at the justice ministry. \nCOURTING THE SOCIALISTS \nLescure, 58, will face a tough balancing act: securing either support or abstention from the Socialists, while preserving Macron’s pro-business legacy and keeping conservatives and liberals on board. \nThe Franco-Canadian and former senior executive at Natixis Asset Management will also need to be mindful of the far right’s budget sensitivities given their readiness to try collapsing the government once more. \nIn a bid to win over the Socialists, Lecornu has proposed a wealth tax long demanded by the left, while excluding business owners’ assets to shield companies and jobs. \nHe has also ruled out using special constitutional powers to push the budget through parliament without a vote. \n(Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Ros Russell) \nBy Geert De Clercq and Richard Lough",

               "text": " Jackson has been selected to join Michigan’s Community Growth Academy, offering new hope for economic growth and opportunities that could keep future generations in the city. \nSam Calagon, a mother of two, is already thinking about what Jackson will look like when her children reach their late twenties. \n”Having kids that are gonna be 27 and 29, maybe they went away to college and dad and I are still here,” Calagon said. \nShe hopes Jackson will remain a viable option for her children’s future. \n”I hope they have the opportunity to do so and that it’s still a city you want to come back to and feel safe in,” Calagon said. \nThat future looks more promising after Jackson’s Chamber of Commerce was selected to be a member of the state’s Community Growth Academy. \nRyan Tarrant, Jackson Chamber President and CEO, explained that the program specifically targets vulnerable communities. \n”They preselected some communities in Michigan that either have lost or are at risk of losing either jobs in the energy or manufacturing sectors,” Tarrant said. \nSince arriving in Jackson over two years ago, Tarrant has focused on driving growth in the community. \n”We’re going to work with those others in that inaugural cohort of ten communities across the state to be able to share best practices, to be able to identify things that will both identify our economy but also provide resiliency in our local economy,” Tarrant said. \nThis initiative aligns perfectly with what Calagon envisions for her sons’ future. \n”I would like it to be a place where you don’t have to move away for opportunities. Things like local businesses around that host events for the community, that bring people back to the space that they grew up, and they see their kids thriving in it as well as maybe the life they’ve made for themselves,” Calagon said. \nThis story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Moscow, Russia. Photo Credit: step-svetlana, Pixabay \nMost people see a market economy and totalitarianism as antithetical phenomena and believe that where one exists, the other cannot. But in fact, even in the darkest days of Stalin’s totalitarian system, a kind of market economy existed albeit not in its own name; and a similar arrangement now exists in Putin’s Russia, Dimitry Savvin says. \nThe editor of the Riga-based conservative Russian portal Harbin points to the case of Nikolay Pavlenko who created a private construction firm which operated in the USSR between 1948 and 1952, a case described by Russian historian Oleg Khlevnyuk in a 2023 Moscow book, The Corporation of Imposters (harbin.lv/algoritm-rynochnogo-pererozhdeniya). \nWhat Pavlenko did was criminal “only” in the official Soviet understanding, Savvin says. In fact, what he did was to “establish a private construction enterprise masked as a military institution and over the course of several years successfully conduct commercial activity” in a totalitarian state. \nAs “phantasmagorical” as that may seem, he continues, “in essence, the mechanisms of coexistence with a totalitarian state and a private commercial enterprise which Pavlenko developed are in many respects typical” and were later employed “not only in the Soviet Union” but also in North Korea and since the 1990s by entrepreneurs in Russia. \nShortly after the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Pavlenko, “suddenly discovered” that if one had the write papers and stamps, one could operate as a kind of covert free market player. He ran one such business during the war and established a second in 1948, when he was routinely sought out by officials because of his good and speedy work. \nEventually the party leadership caught up with him; and in 1952, hie operation was shut down and he was shot. But his operation, which was certainly far from unique, dis played four characteristics that help to explain why such things reemerged in some other communist countries, the post-Soviet USSR, and especially in Putin’s time. \nFirst of all, Pavlenko’s organization was not political but commercial in the purest sense. Second, his organization mimicked state institutions; third, he did nothing criminal except for operating as a private firm in a system that denied that possibility; and fourth, if the leadership hadn’t been obsessed with defending socialism, what he did might have continued. \n            “We see that little islands of market arrangements are natural for man and humanity” and emerge in communist and other totalitarian states, Savvin says, a pattern that requires us to recognize that with the proper masking, free market phenomena can and will exist under totalitarianism rather than being totally excluded by it.   \nSavvin’s observation carries with it another implication that he doesn’t discuss but that is critical for those who want to overcome totalitarianism. In the 1990s, many Western leaders believed that if they got the economy right in the Russian Federation, totalitarianism would be precluded. But in fact that was not true. \nHad such leaders focused more on democratic procedures and laws and worried somewhat less about the economy which they expected would do all the heavy lifting Russians and the world might have been spared the rise of the new totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin now.",

               "text": "Finance Execs Optimistic Despite Expectation of Long-Term Market Uncertainty : SIX Study\nBy Omar Faridi\nSenior executives across the banking and finance sector are reporting a renewed sense of “optimism” or generally positive sentiment in the economic environment for the upcoming year, even though there is a growing belief that increased market uncertainty will be a long-term factor or theme, according to the latest research from Swiss and Spanish stock exchanges operator SIX.\nMore than two-thirds of C-suite executives at various financial institutions across the globe expect the economic environment “to improve for their organization over the next 12 months – up considerably from 53% last year.”\nThat is according to the Future of Finance Study shared recently by SIX – which is an annual survey that canvasses the “opinions of senior executives across 291 financial institutions spanning Germany, Hong Kong , Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.”\nThe findings have been unveiled after benchmark equity indices surged to record highs in 2025 in regions such as the US, UK, Germany , Singapore, Switzerland.\nAnd those in Hong Kong and Spain also surged to their near all-time highs.\nSingapore residents and Switzerland based respondents are said to be the most confident of their organizations’ position for steady growth, with 75% and 63% considering it to be quite “strong,” respectively.\nAnd C-suite executives at US FIs now report the “lowest levels” of confidence in their own organizations’ positions for growth, with merely 43% considering their position to be strong – which the notably only market to score less than 50% on this particular measure.\nNearly all or 99% of executives agree that increased levels of market uncertainty will be a long-term feature of the world economy. But in terms of how to view this uncertainty, respondents are said to be far more divided or not certain. And overall, 58% view this as more of a potential opportunity, meanwhile 41% consider it to be a sort of challenge.\nIn terms of the most significant challenges facing respondents, barriers to global trade and capital flows are the quite frequently reported, with 36% identifying these as their most pressing concern.\nThe other challenges that are typically flagged include hesitation or reluctance among investors to take on additional risks as well as geopolitical uncertainties. The latter has reportedly become one of executives’ primary concerns in three of the last four Future of Finance research studies.\nBjørn Sibbern, CEO SIX said:\n“The ability to adapt to change defines successful organizations. While geopolitical conditions have evolved since our last study, respondents’ determination to succeed remains strong. Managing market volatility requires reliable infrastructure and efficient flows of high-quality data. Working with trusted and innovative partners enables organizations to leverage uncertainty as a driver of growth, not merely a risk to manage.”\nSponsored Links by DQ Promote",

               "site_type": "general",
               "text": " More than half of UK adults now use mobile wallets, according to a report from UK Finance. Recent figures from the Fintech and financial services industry trade body reveal how consumer behavior and payment habits in the UK continue to evolve and how they are now expected to change in the next 10 years. \nFindings from the Payment Markets Report for 2024 indicate: \nThe total number of payments made in the UK last year was “48.6 billion payments, up by 1.5 per cent from 2023.” \nMore people are now using digital payments, with rising use of in-app purchases, digital wallets, and Buy Now Pay Later for shopping. \nBut cash payments have fallen. \nThese trends show how people are increasingly turning to digital payment options, a shift that is “expected to continue in the years ahead.” \nConsumers were responsible for “84 per cent of all payments last year, mostly for day-to-day purchases.” \nBusiness organizations, government agenccies and not-for-profit entities based in the United Kingdom have now accounted for 16 per cent. This reportedly includes salary, pension and benefit payments made to individuals and payments between organisations. \nMore consumers are now said to be using their phones, watches or other mobile devices to manage finances and complete various purchases. \nThere’s been a rise in mobile wallet use for online and contactless payments, with more than half of UK adults (57 per cent) using wallets in the past year, which is up considerably from 42 per cent in 2023. \nUsers who register for a mobile wallet service, seem to become frequent users and where contactless card payments replaced what were once low-value cash payments, now contactless mobile payments “appear to be replacing contactless payments initiated using a physical card.” \nOf those who used mobile payments, half or 50% reportedly used them on a monthly basis, and 44 per cent did it weekly or more even more often than that. \nAlthough younger consumers still lead the way in terms of adoption – “88 per cent of 16–24-year-olds – among those aged 65 and over, registration rose from 14 per cent in 2023 to 25 per cent in 2024. ” \nMobile banking, carried out through a banking app for example, became the most common way to access accounts in 2024, used by “75 per cent of UK adults. It also overtook desktop banking for the first time.” \nBrits now use mobile banking not just to check on their account balances, but to make payments and manage their finances. \nAs a result, Faster Payments – the system which is now behind most real-time bank transfers – increased by about 14 per cent to 5.6 billion transactions this past year, making it the United Kingdom’s second most widely-used payment method after simple payment cards.",

               "title": "Florida Was a Top Destination for Immigrants in Recent Years — and Economy Grew",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " After Paola Freites was allowed into the U.S. in 2024, she and her husband settled in Florida, drawn by warm temperatures, a large Latino community and the ease of finding employment and housing. \nThey were among hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the state in recent years as immigration surged under former President Joe Biden. \nNo state has been more affected by the increase in immigrants than Florida, according to internal government data obtained by The Associated Press. Florida had 1,271 migrants who arrived from May 2023 to January 2025 for every 100,000 residents, followed by New York, California, Texas and Illinois. \nThe data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which must verify addresses of everyone who is allowed to enter the U.S. and stay to pursue an immigration case, shows Miami was the most affected metropolitan area in the U.S. with 2,191 new migrants for every 100,000 residents. Orlando ranked 10th with 1,499 new migrants for every 100,000 residents. Tampa ranked 17th, and Fort Myers was 30th. \nFreites and her husband, who had fled violence in Colombia with their three children, moved to Apopka, an agricultural city near Orlando, where immigrants could find cheaper housing than in Miami as they spread throughout a community that already had large populations of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. Her sister-in-law owned a mobile home that they could rent. \n“She advised us to come to Orlando because Spanish is spoken here and the weather is good,” Freites, 37, said. “We felt good and welcomed.” \nMIGRATION CHANGED AFTER COVID-19 PANDEMIC \nThe CBP data captured the stated U.S. destinations for 2.5 million migrants who crossed the border, including those like Freites who used the now-defunct CBP One app to make an appointment for entry. The data covered the period when the Biden administration ended COVID-19 restrictions on asylum to when President Donald Trump began his second term and declared a national emergency at the border. \nCBP released millions of people in the U.S. at the border during Biden’s presidency to pursue cases in U.S. immigration court, lifting the immigrant population to all-time highs as many people made their way to the U.S. by walking through the once-impenetrable Darién Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama. This year, the Border Patrol released only seven migrants from February through July, as Trump suspended the asylum system and thrust the military into a central role in deterring illegal border crossings. \nFreites said she was tortured and raped in Colombia and her father and 8-month-old baby killed. The family requested asylum, and she and her husband obtained work permits. \nShe is now a housekeeper at a hotel in Orlando, a tourist destination with more than a dozen theme parks, including Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. Her husband works at a plant nursery. \n“We came here looking for freedom, to work. We don’t like to be given anything for free,” said Freites, who asked that the AP identify her by her middle name and second last name for fear of her mother’s safety in Colombia, which has endured more than a half century of conflict. “We are good people.” \nShe, her husband and their three children — ages 16, 13 and 7 — live in a two-bedroom mobile home. The children attend school and she attends a Catholic church that offers Mass in Spanish, the only language she speaks. \nHistorically, Central Florida’s immigrant population was mainly from Mexico and Central America, with a handful of Venezuelan professionals and business owners coming after socialist Hugo Chávez became president in 1999. In 2022, more Venezuelans began to arrive, encouraged by a program created by the Biden administration that offered them a temporary legal pathway. That same program was extended months later to Haitians and Cubans, and their presence became increasingly visible in Central Florida. The state also has a large Colombian population. \nMany immigrants came to Florida because they had friends and relatives there. \nIn Orlando, they settled throughout the area, not just certain neighborhoods. Businesses catering to newer arrivals opened in shopping areas with Mexican and Puerto Rican shops. Venezuelan restaurants selling empanadas and arepas opened in the same plaza as a Mexican supermarket that offers tacos and enchiladas. Churches began offering more Masses in Spanish and in Creole, which Haitians speak. \nAs the population increased, apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses replaced many of the orange groves and forests that once surrounded Orlando. \nTHE ECONOMY GREW AS MORE PEOPLE ARRIVED \nNew immigrants found work in the booming construction industry, as well as in agriculture, transportation, utilities and manufacturing. Many work in restaurants and hotels and as taxi drivers. Some started their own businesses. \n“It’s just like a very vibrant community,” said Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet, executive director at Hope CommUnity Center, a group that offers free services to the immigrant community in Central Florida. “It’s like, ‘I’m going to work hard and I’m going to fight for my American dream,’ that spirit.” \nImmigrants’ contributions to Florida’s gross domestic product — all goods and services produced in the state — rose from 24.3% in 2019 to 25.5% in 2023, according to an American Immigration Council analysis of the Census Bureau’s annual surveys. The number of immigrants in the workforce increased from 2.8 million to 3.1 million, or 26.5% to 27.4% of the overall population. The figures include immigrants in the U.S. legally and illegally. \n“Immigration has made this area better, more diverse,” said Laudi Campo, director of the Hispanic Federation in Florida. “Immigrants have brought an amazingly economic force and great workforce to the area.” \nGroups that help immigrants also increased in size. \n“We got hundreds of calls a week,” said Gisselle Martinez, legal director at the Orlando Center for Justice. “So many calls of people saying ‘I just arrived, I don’t know anybody, I don’t have money yet, I don’t have a job yet. Can you help me?’” \nThe center created a program to welcome them. It grew from serving 40 people in 2022 to 269 in 2023 and 524 in 2024, Melissa Marantes, the executive director, said. \nIn 2023, the Hispanic Federation launched a program to teach doctors, nurses, and engineers from South America and Haiti how to prepare and dress for job interviews and how to answer questions in English. They also expanded their free English language program and offered another to help parents navigate the school system. In 2021, about 500 immigrants attended a fair that provided free dental, medical, and legal services. By 2024, there were 2,500 attendees. \nSousa-Lazaballet, the executive director at Hope, said his group went from serving 6,000 people in 2019, to more than 20,000 in 2023 and 2024. \n“People were welcomed,” Sousa-Lazaballet, the executive director at Hope, said. “It was an incredible moment, when people were coming, people were settling because they have work permits. They could work.” \nMANY NOW FEAR BEING DETAINED \nAfter Trump took office, anxiety spread through many immigrant communities. Florida, a Republican-led state, has worked to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown and has enacted laws targeting illegal immigration. That includes a measure banning people living in the U.S. illegally from entering the state that some law enforcement officers enforced after a judge halted it. \nBlanca, a 38-year-old single mother from Mexico who crossed the border with her three children in July 2024, said she came to Central Florida because four nephews who were already living in the area told her it was a peaceful place where people speak Spanish. The math teacher, who has requested asylum in the U.S. insisted on being identified by her first name only because she fears deportation. \nIn July 2025, immigration officials told her to go to their Orlando office ahead of an October immigration court hearing. There, they placed an electronic bracelet on her ankle to monitor her. \nBecause a friend of hers was deported after submitting a work permit request, she has not asked for one herself, she said. Blanca gets paid under the table by cleaning and cooking for neighbors. Her children ask her not to take them to or from school for fear that the police will see her electronic bracelet and stop and detain her on the street. \n“It’s scary,” she said. “Of course it is.” \nPhoto: Immigrants trying to learn the English language take notes as Eliezer Guerrero of Catholic Charities of Central Florida teaches a class in Orlando in August.
