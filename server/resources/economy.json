               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "By Wesley GrantTHOUGH THE CRYPTO AND DIGITAL ASSETS INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED ITS SHARE OF FADS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, IT HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE STABLECOINS AND BLOCKCHAIN. THESE INNOVATIONS ARE RESHAPING THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE. AMONG THEM, TOKENIZATION HAS SEEN GROWING ADOPTION BY THE WORLD’S LARGEST FINANCIAL PLAYERS—A TREND THAT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN.\nIN HIS LATEST REPORT, TOKENIZATION: GROWTH TREND OR FAD?, JOEL HUGENTOBLER, ANALYST OF CRYPTOCURRENCY AT JAVELIN STRATEGY & RESEARCH, EXPLORES THE GROWING USE CASES FOR TOKENIZATION, THE INCREASING INTEREST FROM INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, AND THE STEPS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD TAKE TO EMBRACE THIS POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY.\nIMPRESSIVE GROWTH RATES\nANY REAL-WORLD ASSET (RWA) CAN BE DIGITIZED AND PLACED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, FROM PROPERTY DEEDS TO STOCKS. THE REASONS TO TOKENIZE ARE MANY—IT IS A SECURE, FULLY TRANSPARENT PROCESS WHERE TRANSACTIONS SETTLE INSTANTLY.\nCOMPARED TO THEIR CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPARTS, TOKENIZED TRANSACTIONS CAN ALSO CARRY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FEES. ONCE AN RWA IS DIGITIZED, IT CAN BE FRACTIONALIZED AND SOLD TO MULTIPLE PARTIES, MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED ILLIQUID AND EXPENSIVE ATTAINABLE TO EVERYDAY INVESTORS.\nFOR ALL THESE REASONS, TOKENIZATION EFFORTS HAVE TAKEN HIGHER PRIORITY AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. EVEN MANY CENTRAL BANKS—SUCH AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND—ARE STARTING TO RECOGNIZE THE TECHNOLOGY’S POTENTIAL.\n“IT’S NOT OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO SEE HUGE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR) NUMBERS FOR EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES OR NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS,” HUGENTOBLER SAID. “BUT DEPENDING ON HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, TOKENIZATION’S PROJECTED CAGRS RANGE ANYWHERE FROM 400% TO 4000%. IT’S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE LAUNCHED FUNDS ON CHAIN HAS SEEN LIKE A 10X IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS.”\nBUILDING A BETTER BLOCKCHAIN\nWHILE ETHEREUM REMAINS THE LEADING BLOCKCHAIN FOR TOKENIZATION, SOLANA IS QUICKLY GAINING GROUND. ONE KEY REASON IS SPEED—THE ETHEREUM NETWORK PROCESSES AROUND 15 TO 30 TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND, WHICH CAN BE INEFFICIENT FOR TOKENIZING HIGH-DEMAND RWAS. IN CONTRAST, SOLANA CAN HANDLE AROUND 1,000 TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND.\nHIGHER FEES ON ETHEREUM HAVE ALSO POSED CHALLENGES FOR MANY TOKENIZATION USE CASES. SOLANA’S TRANSACTION FEES ARE OFTEN MUCH LOWER—SOMETIMES UNDER $0.01 PER TRANSACTION—MAKING IT FAR MORE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR TOKENIZING ASSETS AND PERFORMING COMPLEX OPERATIONS.\nTHESE ADVANTAGES ARE WHY MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INVESTING IN SOLANA. FOR EXAMPLE, FRANKLIN TEMPLETON RECENTLY MOVED THE THIRD-LARGEST TOKENIZED MONEY MARKET FUND, VALUED AT $594 MILLION, ONTO SOLANA.\nAS FAST AS THE BLOCKCHAIN IS, IT COULD SOON GET A MASSIVE UPGRADE. ANZA IS A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FIRM THAT WAS SPLIT OFF FROM SOLANA LABS AND TASKED WITH MANAGING THE AGAVE VALIDATOR CLIENT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.\nIN ITS RECENTLY RELEASED ROADMAP, ANZA ANNOUNCED THAT ITS PRIMARY GOAL IS TO MAKE SOLANA FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE, AIMING TO REACH ONE MILLION TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND.\nINNOVATIONS LIKE THIS ARE AMONG THE KEY REASONS WHY TOKENIZATION PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME MORE PREVALENT IN THE COMING YEARS.\n“THERE HAVE BEEN HUGE ADVANCEMENTS ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE,” HUGENTOBLER TOLD PAYMENTSJOURNAL. “WE HAVE CUSTODIANS THAT HAVE STEPPED UP AND SUBSTANTIALLY DEVELOPED THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, THEIR SECURITY, AND THEIR PROTOCOLS FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS WHO WILL DRIVE THIS FORWARD. THAT’S LED TO THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY GETTING INVOLVED, LIKE FRANKLIN TEMPLETON AND BLACKROCK.”\nTOKENIZING SECURITIES TRADING\nMANY OF THE LEADING FINANCIAL FIRMS ARE ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO OPTIMIZE THE STOCK AND BOND TRADING PROCESS THROUGH TOKENIZATION. WHILE BUYING OR SELLING A STOCK MAY SEEM AS SIMPLE AS A CLICK OF A BUTTON TO MANY MODERN-DAY INVESTORS, THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS BEHIND THE SCENES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY.\nADDITIONALLY, MOST STOCKS ARE STILL BOUGHT AND SOLD DURING BUSINESS HOURS DICTATED BY THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE). BY COMPARISON, CRYPTO AND DIGITAL ASSETS CAN BE TRADED AROUND THE CLOCK, ALL YEAR LONG.\nTHESE BENEFITS, COUPLED WITH THE CONTINUED MAINSTREAM ACCEPTANCE OF CRYPTO, HAVE CAUSED A SHIFT IN SENTIMENT AMONG MANY WALL STREET FIRMS. MOST NOTABLY, CITADEL SECURITIES HAS PREVIOUSLY STEERED WELL CLEAR OF CRYPTO.\nHOWEVER, THIS PHILOSOPHY HAS CHANGED, AS CITADEL RECENTLY SIGNALED ITS INTENTION TO BECOME A LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES. THE FIRM WILL NOW BE LISTED AS A MARKET MAKER ON MAJOR CRYPTO EXCHANGES LIKE COINBASE, BINANCE, AND CRYPTO.COM.\nCITADEL AND FELLOW FINANCIAL GIANT BLACKROCK HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED STARTING THEIR OWN STOCK EXCHANGE, POTENTIALLY BASED IN TEXAS. THE MAIN REASON CITED WAS TO REDUCE THE COST OF TRADING ON THE NYSE, BUT THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SPECULATION THAT THE NEW EXCHANGE COULD BE BUILT ON BLOCKCHAIN AND INCORPORATE TOKENIZED STOCK TRADING.\nWHILE THIS INITIATIVE MAY TAKE TIME TO GET OFF THE GROUND, THERE IS CLEARLY A GROWING PLACE FOR TOKENIZATION IN SECURITIES TRADING.\n“EQUITIES ON THE U.S. STOCK MARKET SIDE ARE SITTING AT A VALUATION OF AROUND $555 TRILLION RIGHT NOW, WHILE ON-CHAIN STOCKS ARE CLOSE TO $5 MILLION, SO THERE’S SO MUCH ROOM FOR THAT TO CONTINUE,” HUGENTOBLER SAID. “BUT I THINK TOKENIZATION OF PRIVATE CREDIT WILL CONTINUE AT A HIGH RATE—TREASURIES AS WELL—AND THERE’S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN THAT HASN’T COME ON-CHAIN YET.”\nPREPARING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF TOKENIZATION\nPAYMENTS MODERNIZATION PROJECTS HAVE BEEN TOP OF MIND FOR MANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR SOME TIME, DRIVEN BY RAPID INNOVATIONS IN THE PAYMENTS SPACE. HOWEVER, TOKENIZATION CAPABILITIES CAN HAVE JUST AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT AS ADOPTING REAL-TIME PAYMENT SUPPORT.\n“THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS USE IS MORE THAN FIVE DECADES OLD, AND WE’RE MOVING TOWARDS THIS DIGITAL ECONOMY THAT HAS SO MANY BENEFITS AND EFFICIENCIES AND CAN HELP BUILD CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND TRUST,” HUGENTOBLER SAID. “HAVING THAT TRANSPARENCY, THOSE ADDITIONAL TOOLS, AND THAT OPTIONALITY DEFINITELY PROVIDES VALUE TO THE END USER.”\nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING MEANS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD EXPLORE WAYS TO IMPLEMENT TOKENIZATION NOW.\n“THEY NEED TO PROACTIVELY BUILD A PLAN, ASSESS THE RISKS, CONDUCT A COST SAVINGS ANALYSIS, AND PREPARE FOR WHAT’S COMING,” HUGENTOBLER SAID. “THOSE THAT WAIT ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGES AND WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. HOWEVER, THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE INDUSTRY COMING ON 15 YEARS NOW, AND THERE’S A LOT OF TALENT AND EXPERIENCE OUT THERE. THEY DON’T NEED TO GO AT THIS ALONE.”\n\n\nLink: https://www.paymentsjournal.com/tokenization-is-playing-a-central-role-in-the-shift-to-a-digital-economy/\n\nSource: https://www.paymentsjournal.com\n\n\n\nThe post Tokenization is playing a central role in the shift to a digital economy appeared first on Fintech News.",

               "text": " Raze, a tokenization engine for real-world assets (RWAs), announced a partnership with Redbelly Network, a blockchain designed specifically for real-world asset tokenization. \nThis collaboration creates a solution for asset issuers looking “to tokenize and trade compliant on-chain structured products.” \nThe partnership brings together Raze’s no-code tokenization platform with Redbelly’s patented “scalable L1 public blockchain infrastructure, enabling businesses and funds to easily create, issue, and manage tokenized real-world assets with unprecedented speed, security, and regulatory compliance.” \nBrian Anderson, CEO and Founder of Raze said: \n“Partnering with Redbelly Network significantly enhances our ability to deliver institutional-grade tokenization solutions. Their purpose-built blockchain infrastructure, with instant finality and verifiable credentials, perfectly complements our mission to make RWAs accessible and borderless. This collaboration will power our growing pipeline of enterprise tokenization deals.” \nRedbelly Network’s blockchain technology, which processes “up to 97,500 transactions per second with instant finality, provides the ideal foundation for Raze’s tokenization engine.” \nThe partnership has demonstrated success through the recent tokenization of a soon to be announced implementation of “a commodities-based RWA, deployed on the Redbelly Network.” \nAlan Burt, CEO at Redbelly Network said: \n“Raze’s tokenization engine represents exactly the kind of innovative application we designed Redbelly Network to support. By combining our high-performance blockchain infrastructure with Raze’s user-friendly platform, we’re creating a powerful pathway for traditional assets to enter the digital economy with the compliance, security, and efficiency that institutional partners demand.” \nThe Raze-Redbelly partnership delivers numerous advantages for asset issuers: \nThe Raze-Redbelly partnership comes at a pivotal moment in the RWA tokenization market, with Raze having “secured three enterprise deals representing a pipeline exceeding $650 million in tokenized assets.” \nThe companies will continue to collaborate on “developing specialized tokenization solutions for specific asset classes, including real estate, private credit, commodities, and structured products.” \nRedbelly Network enables Real World Asset (RWA) issuers to “build Web3.0 registries and compose tokenized assets into on-chain structured products.” \nWith Superblock scalability technology, Redbelly delivers efficiency and throughput, processing up to “97,500 transactions per second with instant finality.” \nThe network reportedly combines clean liquidity with network-wide verifiable credentials, “enabling structured products with composable eligibility criteria for global investors.”",

               "title": "Last Gasp Of The Landfill Economy",
               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": "Last Gasp Of The Landfill Economy\nby Tyler Durden\nAuthored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,\nIt seems we’re supposed to mourn the last gasp of The Landfill Economy. Perhaps we should celebrate its demise.\nGlobalization’s great gift wasn’t low prices--it was the collapse of durability, transforming the global economy into a Landfill Economy of shoddy products made of low-cost components guaranteed to fail, poor quality control, planned obsolescence and accelerated product cycles--all hyper-profitable, all to the detriment of consumers and the planet.\nGlobalization also accelerated another hyper-profitable gambit: . Since all the products are now made with the same low-quality components, they all fail regardless of brand or price. The $2,000 refrigerator lasts no longer than the $700 fridge. Since the manufacturers and retailers all know the products are destined for the landfill by either design or default, warranties are uniformly one-year--and it’s semi-miraculous if the consumer can find anyone to act on replacing or repairing the failed product even with the warranty.\nIn The Landfill Economy, Consumer choice is pure illusion. I’d like to buy once, cry once, so where is the option with a 10-year all parts and labor warranty? There isn’t one, because nothing is durable--by design or default.\nAs a result, The Landfill Economy is fundamentally extortionist. We know this product will fail, you know this product will fail, and so here’s our offer: buy a 3-year extended warranty for a hefty sum, because we’ve engineered the product to fail in four years.\nIf the product is digital, then even if it still functions, we’ll force you to replace it via a new product cycle: we no longer support the old operating system, and since your device is out of date (heh) it can’t load the new OS, and since all the apps now only function with the new OS, your device is useless.\nThe low price is also illusory, as we now have to buy four, five or ten products instead of one durable product. Appliances that once lasted 40 years now fail in 6 or 7 years if not sooner, so over the course of 40 years we have to buy five, six or seven appliances instead of one.\nNote that these durable products weren’t super-expensive commercial appliances; they were ordinary consumer appliances produced domestically in vast quantities.\nDigitization is a key driver of The Landfill Economy, as cheap electronics all fail, and the product / vehicle / tool becomes a brick. Since inventory is an expense, it’s been eliminated, so parts for older products are soon out of stock and unavailable.\nIn a few years, the firmware is no longer supported, and in a few decades, nobody will even know what coding was embedded in the chipset, but it won’t matter anyway, because the chipsets are long gone.\nReaders tell me vehicles are now wondrously reliable. Um, yeah, until they need to be repaired. Then the cost is higher than what I’ve paid for entire used cars.\nA friend was showing us his 1957 Chevrolet Bel-Air. Unlike the  stainless steal  and low-quality chrome of today, the original parts are still untarnished. Since the entire vehicle is analog, parts can be scrounged or fabricated or swapped out with a similar set-up.\nDoes anyone seriously believe that a chipset-software-dependent vehicle today will still be running 68 years from now? Analog parts can be cast or welded; customized chipsets and firmware coding cannot. The original components will all be history.\nOur friend recounted a very typical story about repairing his recent-model pickup truck. Since the engine was no longer responding to the accelerator, he borrowed a diagnostic computer (horribly expensive to maintain due to the extortionist monthly fee to keep the software upgraded) and came up with zip, zero, nada.\nAfter swapping out the fuel pump at great expense and finding the problem persisted, he went online to YouTube University and found one video that explained the relay box from the accelerator to the engine didn’t show up in the diagnostic codes, so the problem could not be identified.\nThe relay box cost $400, and likely consisted of components worth no more than a few dollars each. So after $1,000 in parts and his own labor, the problem was finally fixed. If this qualifies as ”super-reliable and maintenance-free,” then the diagnosis is obvious: mass delusion.\nSo now the status quo is desperate to maintain the global assembly lines feeding the hyper-profitable Landfill Economy. This may well be the last gasp of The Landfill Economy, as the supply chains of shoddy products designed to fail will break and consumers may well awaken to the high cost over time of an economy based on planned obsolescence, accelerated product cycles and extortionist illusions of choice.\nLast week I bought an expensive portable solar panel manufactured in China from a local distributor. The U.S. brand distributing the product has a good reputation for quality. Of course the warranty is for one year.\nThe panel failed in less than a week: I smelled the unmistakable odor of an electrical short (insulation melting) and noticed the plastic rectangle that the output cord extended from was dimpled by high heat. The plastic part had no visible way to open it, and no visible way to replace it. So the entire panel is unrepairable.\n(The local distributor had one in stock, so I was able to get a replacement. Here’s hoping it has a non-defective set of components.)\nIt’s doubtful anyone has the parts in stock, and it’s also doubtful that it could be repaired even if one pried open the plastic casing to examine the melted bits. The parts are in one place--the factory that assembled the panel.\nSo this panel, manufactured at great expense of costly materials, will end up in the landfill after five days of service. And no, it won’t be recycled, as there’s no system to do so, and it doesn’t make financial sense to even try.\nWow, isn’t The Landfill Economy fantastic? Look how profitable it is, as consumers must constantly replace or repair at great expense everything that comes off the wonderful global supply chains. And since we worship ”growth” and profits, The Landfill Economy is the ideal arrangement--for those making and selling all the stuff.\nFor the consumers--not so much, but who cares, since they have no choice but to keep buying shoddy products designed to fail.\nAdd the defective solar panel to the long list of other failed products in our household: the iPhone screen that failed, the washer that failed, the dryer that failed (which I was able to fix by replacing the motherboard, which only cost half the price of a new dryer with my ”free” labor), the failed fridge, defective toaster from Walmart, shoes from Costco that fell apart in a few months, and the failed AC system in our 2016 Honda Civic. (Mention this to any mechanic and they quickly nod, ”oh yeah, those all fail.”)\nAll of this failure generates ”growth” and profits, the two Grails every economist worships. Here’s another load of ”growth” going straight into the landfill.\nIt seems we’re supposed to mourn the last gasp of The Landfill Economy. Perhaps we should celebrate its demise.\n*  *  *",

               "text": " LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rachel Reeves wrote in a column for the Observer due to be published on Sunday that she wants to achieve ”an ambitious new relationship” with the European Union while still negotiating a trade deal with the United States. \nIn a separate article from Reeves’ column on Saturday, the Observer said the finance minister wrote that tariffs introduced by U.S. President Donald Trump will have a ”profound” effect on Britain and world economies. \nReeves will say that she is ”under no illusion about the difficulties that lie ahead,” according to the Observer. \n”The Labour party is an internationalist party. We understand the benefits of free and fair trade and collaboration. Now is not the time to turn our backs on the world.” \nThe finance minister plans to advocate for a ”more balanced global economic and trading system” at the upcoming International Monetary Fund meeting later this month. \nBritain’s economy returned to growth in February with its fastest expansion in 11 months, beating economists’ expectations and placing it on a slightly firmer footing as it braces for the impact of the tariffs. \nMeanwhile, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, the director of the United Nations trade agency, said on Friday that tariffs and countermeasures could have a ”catastrophic” impact on developing countries, hitting even harder than foreign aid cuts. \n(Reporting by Sam Tabahriti; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

Crypto expert Olivia Vande Woude says Avalanche will change the landscape for traditional finance as we know it.\n\nAVALANCHE WILL MODERNIZE LEGACY RTGS SYSTEMS\nAccording to an X post, business development expert Olivia Vande Woude remarks that Avalanche will improve current offerings for mainstream finance. Right out the bat, Woude notes that the lowest hanging fruit for AVAX will be changing outdated rails in legacy finance.\n\nWoude argues that rather than a wholesale replacement, an Avalanche integration will improve legacy RTGS systems like SWIFT and Fedwire. Perhaps, the biggest area of improvement will be in conventional post-trade infrastructure bogged down by fragmented reconciliation. Woude notes that the network can introduce real-time finality and liquidity efficiency for post-trade infrastructure.\n\nLarge exchange infrastructure is tipped to record seismic changes following an Avalanche integration, says Woude. While CBOE and ICE grapple with execution latency, Woud was Avalanche’s decentralization can reduce slippage for legacy exchanges.\n\n“Avalanche does for finance what fiber optics did for telecom,” said Woude. “It’s replacing outdated rails with real-time, high-throughput, low-latency execution.”\n\nWoude points out in her statement that Avalanche’s tamper-proof infrastructure will improve the batch processing systems employed by traditional custodians. The derivatives markets will receive their fair share of changes, leaning on Avalanche’s collateral optimization and margin logic based on advanced smart contracts.\n\nAmid soaring regulatory changes in the US, traditional financial institutions can unlock new revenue streams in tokenization via blockchain-based integrations.\n\nBENEFITS EXTEND TO FUNDING MARKETS AMID SOARING AVAX PRICE\nWoude highlights the benefits of an integration in short-term funding markets by leaning on its dynamic discounting. Furthermore, the blockchain offers programmable yield analytics designed to revolutionize the operations of repo settlements and liquidity management in funding markets.\n\nAn EVM compatibility will allow institutions to still deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, smoothening the curve for tokenized funds. As the US SEC approves options trading for Ethereum spot ETFs, Avalanche can offer financial institutions permission chains for compliance while offering on-chain derivatives mirroring ETF performance.\n\n“Avalanche isn’t just modernizing financial infrastructure, it’s reprogramming it,” said Woude. “Institutions adopting Avalanche in turn gain a meaningful edge in speed, efficiency, and transparency.”\n\nAVAX price has gained nearly 8% over the last day driven by a broader crypto market rebound and rising institutional adoption for Avalanche. AVAX is trading at $20 while daily trading volumes have spiked by 7% buoyed by bullish chatter around the network.\n\nThe post Expert Outlines Reasons Why Avalanche Will Revolutionize Traditional Finance appeared first on CoinGape.",

               "text": " close \nVideo \n’SNL’ LEGENDS DESCRIBE HOW COMEDY HAS BECOME ’SNARKIER,’ MORE POLITICAL SINCE THEY STARTED \nLegendary ”Saturday Night Live” cast members Jon Lovitz and Kevin Nealon reflect on how comedy has changed since they started in the business. \n”Saturday Night Live” took another swipe at President Donald Trump this weekend, drawing a bold comparison between Trump and Jesus in its latest cold open. \n”It’s me, your favorite president, Donald Jesus Trump, comparing myself to the Son of God once again,” said cast member James Austin Johnson, reprising his role as the exaggerated Trump. \nThe sketch opened with a dramatization of a Bible scene: Jesus flipping tables in a temple over merchants selling goods. But just a few seconds in, Trump hijacks the scene with a monologue, recapping the week’s economic headlines with his usual bravado. \n”Many people are calling me the Messiah,” he says. \nSNL SKIT TAKES AIM AT TRUMP’S TARIFFS AND TESLA VANDALISM: ’MAKE AMERICA GREAT DEPRESSION AGAIN’ \n”Because of the mess-I-ah made out of the economy.” \nJames Austin Johnson as President Donald Trump during the ”Trump Tariff Cold Open” on SNL, Saturday, April 5, 2025.  (NBC/Getty Images) \nHe then likens the recent rollercoaster in stock prices to the resurrection: ”It’s true, the stock market did a Jesus. It died, then on the third day it was risen. And then on a fourth day, it died again, possibly never to return. Just like Jesus.” \nThe sketch pokes fun at Trump’s recent tariff decisions, which made headlines after sending markets tumbling for a time. Earlier this month, the latest round of tariffs went into effect, triggering investor panic.  \nDays later, the White House announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs while trade deals were renegotiated, though Trump still imposed an increased tariff on China. The temporary pause gave the stock market a brief boost before it dropped again. \n’SNL’ TAKES AIM AT MORGAN WALLEN ONE WEEK AFTER COUNTRY STAR’S ABRUPT EXIT OFFSTAGE \n”Jesus Christ is a name we’ve been saying a lot lately,” Johnson’s Trump continues.  \n”We look in our 401k and say, ‘Jesus Christ, where did it all go?’” \nL-R: Marcello Hernández, musical guest Lizzo, host Jon Hamm, and Bowen Yang during Promos in Studio 8H on Thursday, April 10, 2025. (NBC/Getty Images) \nThe show didn’t stop there. The sketch also tackled rising inflation, specifically the price of eggs, a nod to both Easter traditions and economic concerns. \n”We love Easter. We love bunny. We love hunting for eggs, just like everyone’s doing in the grocery store right now. Because they cost a trillion billion dollars,” he quipped. \nHe added, ”I thought that was what the whole campaign was about. But I just can’t crack it.” \nWhile the real Trump did address soaring egg prices in last month’s joint address to Congress, blaming President Biden and promising to ”make America affordable again,” SNL’s version questioned not just his economic policies but also his religious authenticity. \nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \n”Easter mass is always packed, right? And you know what’s sad? Some people only go to church on Christmas and Easter,” fake Trump says.  \n”Not me! I don’t go on those days either.” \nVideo \nThe monologue wrapped up with one last Easter punchline: ”In the holiest of seasons, Easter, let us remember the lesson Mr. Jesus taught… we must never mix religion with commerce.” \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \n”You can read all about that in my Trump Bible.” \nMadison is a production assistant for Fox News Digital on the Flash team.",

               "text": "The CEO of the largest asset manager on Earth says that despite the current market volatility and uncertainty, the “mega trends” driving the financial world are still intact.\n\nIn a new discussion on CNBC, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that the big trends like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and other cutting edge technology plays are still valid.\n\nHowever, Fink says that some of those plays may be delayed or changed slightly due to President Trump’s tariffs and the likelihood of a recession.\n\n“I do believe that the mega trends are still with us, whether it’s AI, data centers, infrastructure, the whole reorientation of our economy. So I think the mega force trends are not going to change by what has happened. But maybe the execution of some of these trends may be delayed or may be pushed out longer, but I still remain to be optimistic over the long run. Yes, we have to recalibrate, [and] I do believe we’re probably starting, or if not, in a recession.\n\nYes, I think the market is still underestimating how high inflation can get, as you factor in all the tariffs, you factor in all these other issues, it’s going to be quite additive. I read in a report that if you just take the tariffs in the cost of home building, the average new home could be up as much as 26%. We already have a housing affordability problem…\n\nThis is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we’ve created… The United States in post-World War II was a global stabilizer. We are [now] the global destabilizer.”\n\nFollow us on X, Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon’t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox \n\nCheck Price Action\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: OPINIONS EXPRESSED AT THE DAILY HODL ARE NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.
