               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " MONTREAL (Reuters) -Air Canada is betting on free beer and wine at the back of the plane to help fill more seats, an executive said on Wednesday, as North American airlines face passenger pushback over fees for extra baggage to legroom. \nMontreal-based Air Canada is now the only North American legacy carrier offering free alcohol in economy class on all flights, Scott O’Leary, vice president of loyalty and product, said in an interview. \n”Food and beverage just tend to have a disproportionate impact on customer satisfaction, more than any other attribute of our products and services,” he said. \nFollowing an outpouring of anger by passengers on social media, lawmakers in Canada and the United States criticized airlines last year, including Air Canada, for levying additional fees on luggage and seat assignments in certain economy classes. \nWaiving charges for beer and wine is more affordable than cutting baggage fees which offset handling costs, O’Leary said. \n”That’s just not something that’s easily waived or given to everybody without having to have some impact on ticket price,” he said of baggage fees. \nWhile transborder travel is down from Canada to U.S. leisure destinations due to trade tensions, O’Leary sees the free drinks helping with so-called sixth freedom flights that take U.S. passengers to Europe or Asia via the airline’s home country. \n”Our ability to offer a degree of differentiation that sets us apart from literally every other airline that we’re competing with on those routes was very important to us,” he said. \nCanada’s largest carrier said in September it expects a hit of C$375 million to its operating income, and provided a revised outlook for 2025 results, citing labor disruptions, after its flight attendants went on a four-day strike in August.   \n(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Richard Chang)",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Some folks have gotten a bit carried away with the revisions that put the second quarter growth rate at 3.8 percent. That does look impressive in isolation, but it is important to remember the economy shrank at a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter. \nThat puts the average at 1.6 percent for the first half of the year. That’s not terrible but it is hardly cause for celebration. Remember, the economy grew 2.4 percent last year and the vast majority of forecasters expected growth at this rate to continue. \nAnd we really do need to look at the two quarters together. Just as unusual factors were responsible for the fall in GDP we saw in the first quarter, they are also responsible for the strong growth reported for the second quarter. \nTo take the most notable example, the lower trade deficit added 4.83 percentage points (PP) to growth in the second quarter. A pre-tariff surge in the trade deficit subtracted 4.63 PP from growth in the first quarter. Only a devoted Trumper would focus on the second quarter number without mentioning the first quarter jump in the trade deficit. \nMoving beyond the irregular numbers, we get that non-residential fixed investment added 0.98 PP to growth in the second quarter after adding 1.24 PP in the first quarter. The first quarter growth was partly due to pre-tariff stockpiling but the second quarter growth on top of this indicates we are looking at something sort of real. This is the AI boom. If that turns into a bust, we will see this growth quickly reversed. \nConsumption accounts for the bulk of GDP and here the story is pretty blah. The second quarter’s growth rate was a healthy 2.5 percent, accounting for 1.68 PP of the quarter’s growth. But this followed a growth rate of just 0.6 percent in the first quarter, leaving an average of rate of 1.6 percent for the first half. That’s not horrible, but certainly not great. \nWe also have seen evidence that the growth in consumption has been concentrated among higher income people who are spending their stock gains. That is consistent with my simple measure of looking at real spending at fast food restaurants. I consider this useful since it’s unlikely that rich people increase their consumption of fast food because their stock portfolio is worth more. \nAnd spending on fast food has to rank as largely a discretionary purchase. It is one thing that is relatively easy to cut back on if a family has to tighten its belts. Real spending at fast food restaurants was just 0.3 percent higher in the second quarter than the average for 2024. That doesn’t look like most people are feeling good about the economy. \nTomorrow, we will get new data on consumption for August, along with revisions for prior months’ data. Maybe that will show a different story, but for now, it looks like we have a weak economy that is being sustained by the AI boom. That boom could go on for a while and keep the economy moving forward, but it may not. \nThis article first appeared on Dean Baker’s \nBeat the Press \n blog.",

It's projected to increase from $260.65 billion in 2024 to $314.55 billion in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.7%. This unprecedented growth during the historical period is a result of multiple factors. These include the emergence of online platforms and social media, the rising popularity of peer-to-peer lending, the increased use of cryptocurrency and blockchain, the uptick in sustainability and green finance, and the expansion of embedded finance.\n\nAnticipations suggest a rapid surge in the size of the alternative finance market over the next few years, potentially reaching as far as $659.94 billion by 2029, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.4%. This anticipated growth during the forecast period can be linked to numerous factors, namely the increasing number of tech-oriented lenders, the burgeoning adoption of decentralized finance, the expanding application of artificial intelligence, the growing favour for initial coin offerings, and the surge in microfinance initiatives. The upcoming trends throughout the forecasting period encompass advancements in technology, AI and data analytics utilization, increased embracing of the internet-of-things, and the emergence of blockchain-based alternative lending platforms.\n\nClaim Your Free Sample Report:\n\nwww.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=16586&type=smp\n\nWhat Are the Key Drivers Fueling Growth in the Alternative Finance Market?\n\nThe surge in small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) is anticipated to fuel the expansion of the alternative finance market. SMBs are firms that fall within defined guidelines related to employee count, annual revenue, or assets. The proliferation of SMBs can be attributed to various factors such as crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, tax incentives, and business development programs. {loadads}Alternative finance supports SMBs by offering varied and readily available funding alternatives that tackle some of the restrictions and obstacles inherent in conventional financing methods. For example, the Department for Business and Trade, a UK government department, reported in October 2023 that the count of SMBs escalated from 5.50 million in 2022 to 5.54 million in 2023. Hence, the rising count of SMBs propels the progression of the alternative finance market.\n\nWhich Key Segments Are Driving Growth in the Alternative Finance Market?\n\nThe alternative financemarket covered in this report is segmented –\n\n1) By Type: Peer-To-Peer Lending, Crowdfunding, Invoice Trading, Other Types\n\n2) By Business Model: Traditional Lending, Alternate Marketplace Lending\n\n3) By End User: Enterprise, Individuals\n\nSubsegments:\n\n1) By Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Lending: Consumer P2P Lending, Business P2P Lending, Real Estate P2P Lending, Marketplace Lending\n\n2) By Crowdfunding: Equity Crowdfunding, Reward-Based Crowdfunding, Donation-Based Crowdfunding, Debt Crowdfunding\n\n3) By Invoice Trading: Invoice Factoring, Invoice Discounting, Supply Chain Financing, Reverse Factoring\n\n4) By Other Types: Revenue-Based Financing, Equity-Based Financing, Asset-Backed Lending, Cryptocurrencies And Blockchain-Based Financing, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Venture Debt Financing\n\nAccess the Full Report Today:\n\nwww.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/alternative-finance-global-market-report\n\nWhich Emerging Trends Will Impact the Alternative Finance Market in the Forecast Period?\n\nKey players in the alternative finance sector are concentrating on creating novel services, for instance, the Short-Term Alternative Finance Fund, in an effort to consolidate their standing in this market. The Short-Term Alternative Finance Fund is a dedicated investment platform for private credit assets with durations of less than one year, offering institutional investors an option that provides lower volatility compared to cash and short-dated credit possibilities. In 2024, an example of this was demonstrated by Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), a UK asset management and investment solutions firm, which launched its own Short-Term Alternative Finance Fund. This service offers alternative finance as investors pursue low volatility, short-duration credit options. This fund, situated under LGIM's new RAIF platform, seeks to fulfill the growing demand for liquidity-focused private credit options, such as trade receivables and asset-backed financing, with target investors being entities like pension funds and insurance companies. A wider industry trend is highlighted by this action, with institutions increasingly leaning towards private credit assets over traditional cash reserves.

We’ll review how the rally from the August 01, 2025 low unfolded as a 5-wave impulse followed by a 3-swing correction (ABC) and discuss our forecast for the next move. Let’s dive into the structure and expectations for this ETF. \nIn the 1-hour Elliott Wave count from Sep 24, 2025, we saw that $XLF completed a 5-wave impulsive cycle at red 1. As expected, this initial wave prompted a pullback. We anticipated this pullback to unfold in 3 swings, likely finding buyers in the equal legs area between $53.62 and $53.08. \nThis setup aligns with a typical Elliott Wave correction pattern (ABC), in which the market pauses briefly before resuming its primary trend. \nThe weekend update, from Sep 28, 2025, shows that the ETF bounced as predicted allow longs to get risk free. Currently, it is trading higher in wave ((x)) connector before a double correction takes place. A break above 54.51 will open the next leg higher and negate any lower prices. \nIn conclusion, our Elliott Wave analysis of Financial Select Sector ($XLF) suggests that it remains supported against August 2025 lows. As a result, traders should buy the dips and monitor the $56–$58 zone as the next potential target. In the meantime, keep an eye out for any corrective pullbacks that may offer entry opportunities. By applying Elliott Wave Theory, traders can better anticipate the structure of upcoming moves and enhance risk management in volatile markets.",

DeXe (DEXE) and MYX Finance (MYX) follow as top performers with double-digit gains. \nZcash trades above $120 at the time of writing on Thursday, marking over 100% gains so far this week. The rally ignited with the launch of Grayscale’s Zcash Trust for eligible investors in a private placement. The Trust’s assets under management exceed $46 million, with a net asset value per share of $9.70 as of Thursday. \nZEC exceeds the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $111, retraced from the $372 high in May 2021 to the $15 low in July 2024. A decisive close above this level could extend the rally to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $189. \nCoinGlass data shows a more than 200% rise in ZEC Open Interest (OI) over the last 24 hours, reaching $120 million, indicating a significant capital inflow into Zcash derivatives. Validating the risk-on sentiment, the OI-weighted funding rate has flipped positive to 0.0491%, from -0.0711% earlier on the day. \nZEC derivatives data.

Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) surges above its zero line with successive rises in the green histogram bars. \nZEC/USDT weekly price chart. \nLooking down, if ZEC drops below $111, the key areas of support for ZEC lie at the $100 psychological level, followed by the 50% retracement level at $76. \nDeXe edges higher by 1% at press time on Thursday, holding above the $10.00 level after an 18% rise from the previous day. DeXe gains traction as the large wallet investors, popularly known as whales, show interest. \nCryptoQuant data shows a significant increase in the number of whale orders in recent days, indicating a notable rise in demand. If this trend continues, the general demand-supply rule suggests an uptrend. \nDeXe Spot Average Order Size. Source: CryptoQuant \nThe immediate resistance for DeXe rally lies at the R1 pivot level at $12.68. The technical indicators on the daily chart corroborate the demand surge as the RSI at 72 remains overbought. Meanwhile, the MACD bounces off its signal line, indicating a second wave of buying pressure. \nDEXE/USDT daily price chart. \nIf the trend flips, DeXe could find support levels at the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $9.856. \nMYX Finance extends the reversal from the $8.20 low on September 22, inching closer to its all-time high of $19.00. At the time of writing, MYX is up nearly 3% on Thursday following the 5% gains from the previous day. \nA potential daily close above $19.00 will confirm the consolidation range breakout formed with the baseline at $8.20. Pivot levels indicate the overhead resistance at $22.52 and $29.78, which align with the R1 and R2 levels, respectively. \nThe RSI at 67 remains flat, indicating a position under the overbought zone, which signals elevated levels of bullish momentum. Additionally, the MACD and its signal line indicate an uptrend, characterized by rising green histogram bars. \nMYX/USDT daily price chart. \nOn the flip side, the centre pivot line at $11.74 could act as the immediate support if MYX reverses from $19.00.",

               "text": "The US labor market has been weakening since the beginning of year, but payrolls plunged in September according to ADP Research data. The United States got some unexpected news on Wednesday, according to a ADP Research report US private companies shed an estimated 32,000 jobs in September instead of gaining over 50,000 as had been forecast. This is the largest drop for the labor market since March 2023. \nFurthermore, the payroll processing company revised their August number down from an estimated 54,000 increase to a 3,000 loss in jobs. This marks the second month of weak jobs data reported by ADP and three out of the past four have now seen private payroll losses. \n“Despite the strong economic growth we saw in the second quarter, this month’s release further validates what we’ve been seeing in the labor market, that U.S. employers have been cautious with hiring,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson in a statement. \nOnly large businesses adding jobs \nThe majority of job losses were in businesses with less that 50 employees. Those with less than 20 eliminated 19,000 jobs while companies with between 20 and 49 employees cut 21,000 payrolls. \nMid-sized companies, those with from 50 to 249 employees and 250 to 499, offloaded 11,000 and 9,000 payrolls, respectively. Only large companies saw gains, adding 33,000 payrolls. \nUS Treasuries jump in response to weak job data \nThis jobs data will most likely be the last to be released this week due to the federal government shutdown. With lawmakers on Capitol Hill unable to come to an agreement on a stopgap bill to keep the federal government funded, employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was due to publish the official government weekly jobs report on Friday, have been sent home. \nWithout government data, traders will have to rely on private data to guide them on what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates when policymakers meet at the end of the month. ADP’s report sent US Treasuries surging reports Bloomberg as investors increase their bets that the Fed will cut interest rates at the next meeting. \nGet your game on!

               "text": "By: Oliver Fisher\n\nMore details continue to emerge regarding AC Milan and Inter’s new stadium project, and now the banks in the running to finance it have emerged.\n\nEarlier in the week, it was confirmed that the City Council had voted to approve the sale of San Siro to Milan and Inter. The road is not free of obstacles yet – with several appeals expected – but multi-year project looks more likely than ever to begin.\n\nWHO WILL FINANCE IT?\nAccording to Il Sole 24 Ore (via MilanNews), the purchase of the current stadium and surrounding area will cost €197m. The overall cost of the new stadium project for the two Milanese clubs is expected to be around €1.5bn.\n\nMany of the world’s leading banks are vying to contribute to the construction of this new facility with financing of around €1.2bn. The remainder of the cost, of course, could be provided by other investors or the clubs themselves.\n\nPhoto by Marco Luzzani/Getty ImagesWhich banks are in the running to finance the new stadium? Those in pole position are the American banks, namely Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Bank of America, each of whom already have significant interests in European football.\n\nThe dossier is also on the table of the Japanese Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group as well as BancoBPM. Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit are currently not expected to be part of the running.\n\nThe financing will take the form typical of large sports infrastructure projects, with equity and debt, and the creation of a special purpose vehicle with 50% ownership by Inter and Milan. It is also expected that a smaller bridging loan may be provided before the large loan is granted.\n\nThe post Sole 24 Ore: How Milan and Inter’s new stadium will be finances and the banks interested appeared first on SempreMilan.",

He praised the French investment in Syria as a “genuine support and strong backing for the benefit of the Syrian people.” \nSyrian ministers participating in the forum stated that they discussed joint investment projects with French companies in the fields of communications and information infrastructure, rehabilitation of the transport sector and development of tourism. \nMember of the Franco-Arab Chamber of Commerce, Naaman Adamo, stressed the need to work on improving the investment situation in Syria, which would have a positive impact on the living conditions of all Syrians.

               "text": "WATCH LIVE\nKey Points\nThe Kremlin’s commitment to the Ukraine war was in focus this week after the finance ministry released its 2026 draft budget.\nDraft spending plans show defense spending next year will stay largely static, and will be funded with tax hikes.\nRussia’s finance ministry has said it plans to hike VAT.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on development of ’new regions’, annexed from Ukraine, at the Kremlin, June 30, 2025, in Moscow, Russia.\nContributor | Getty Images\nRussia is set to hike taxes on businesses and consumers as the government looks for ways to support military spending while its war-focused economy creaks at the seams.\nThe Kremlin’s commitment to the ongoing war with Ukraine came under renewed scrutiny Monday when the finance ministry released its 2026 draft budget. The spending plans show defense spending next year would stay largely static, and would be funded with tax hikes amid increasingly dour growth forecasts.\nPresenting the budget this week, Russia’s finance ministry said that in order ”to finance defense and security” it was proposing a number of tax hikes that it said were an alternative to increased borrowing and a way reduce the budget deficit, which was forecast at 1.6% of GDP in 2026.\nMost notably, ministry officials said they planned to increase VAT from 20% to 22% , while the threshold at which small businesses start to pay VAT will be lowered from 60 million rubles (around $738,000) to 10 million rubles (around $123,000). The ministry also proposed a new 5% gambling tax.\nThe proposed tax hikes come as economic growth is expected to stutter to 1.3% in 2026 , the government said — a far cry from the 4.1% expansion recorded in 2024 and a sharp drop from the previous projections for 2.5% growth this year and 2.4% next year.\nThe preliminary budget — which needs to be approved by the Russian parliament, the State Duma — suggested that defense spending would fall slightly in 2026, to 13 trillion rubles ($157 billion), down from a post-soviet record of 13.5 trillion rubles (or $163 billion) this year, according to preliminary finance ministry figures obtained by Reuters last week.\nRussian public on the hook\nThe Russian public is effectively being told to pay for the war against Ukraine, analysts said of the budget proposals, warning that the country was entering a low-growth era.\n”As economic growth stalls and revenues decline, Moscow is no longer able to pump up the fiscal stimulus that fueled earlier wartime expansion, instead embracing austerity measures that threaten to further strangle the civilian economy,” Alexander Kolyander, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, noted in analysis this week.\n”Moscow’s financial strategy for the fifth year of war is unmistakable ... the Kremlin will attempt to muddle through without major expenditure increases, instead passing the war’s costs to  the whole of society,” he said.\nA Moscow shopping mall pictured earlier this year.\nAnadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\nThe new budget confirms that ”the Russian public is paying for the war,” Alexandra Prokopenko, fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in analysis Wednesday.\nNoting that the 2026 budget looks ”more and more like a compromise between the war camp and economists,” she said ”footing the bill will be the Russian people, who face further tax hikes.”\nShe cautioned that the nominal reduction in defense spending in 2026 ”is certainly not a sign that the Kremlin plans to end its war against Ukraine.”\n”Budget spending in the national defense category may be declining from 13.4 trillion rubles this year to 12.6 trillion rubles in 2026 (a decrease of 4.2%), but spending in an adjacent category — national security and law enforcement— is increasing from 3.46 trillion to 3.91 trillion rubles: a 13% increase,” Prokopenko noted.\nInflation eyed\nRussia’s war against Ukraine, which began in 2022, prompted a sea-change in the country’s economy, with rampant government spending on defense and the military-industrial complex fueling both economic growth but also inflation, which was further exacerbated by sanctions, labor shortages and higher wage demand, and supply constraints.\nPrice rises, particularly of basic goods like butter and meat , have been hard on Russian consumers. The country’s central bank has looked to tame inflation with high interest rates, increasing borrowing costs for businesses and acting, paradoxically, as another brake on economic growth. The latest data showed inflation stood at 8.1% in August, while the central bank’s benchmark interest rate was at 17%.\nA customer with a cart chooses cheese at the Okey supermarket in St. Petersburg. \nSopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nRussia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was grilled by state media outfit TASS this week on the rationale behind tax rises on consumers and entrepreneurs . He told the agency that they were preferable to increased borrowing, which would fuel inflation.\n”An uncontrolled increase in public debt would lead to accelerated inflation and, consequently, an increase in the key rate. Conversely, the decision to balance the budget through tax increases gives the Central Bank room to ease monetary policy. The key rate is crucial for investment growth and economic growth,” he told TASS.\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (seen here with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019) reportedly told Russian newspaper Vedomosti that Moscow will continue to service external debts in rubles, but foreign Eurobond holders will need to open ruble and hard currency accounts with Russian banks in order to receive payments.\nMikhail Svetlov | Getty Images News | Getty Images\nAsked if the defense budget would increase, Siluanov suggested that national security would become more of a focus for the government with defense and security expenditures set to take into account ”additional tasks and challenges.”\nThese, he suggested, included ”other functional areas related less to military defense than to ensuring the security of the country and its citizens as a whole.”\nThis included the development of counter-drone systems, the protection of critical infrastructure and border areas, enhanced transport security, and cybersecurity, he said. ”Overall spending in 2026 remains at a level comparable to 2025, but is higher than the 2024 level,” he noted.",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " BRUSSELS, Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Business services industry emerges as a dual powerhouse for European economy, being global shock absorber and strategic enabler of long-term transformation. 40 million people work in business services in Europe, contributing EUR 3.5 trillion to the EU 27’s GDP – 20.4% of the total. The latest ABSL report outlines transformation scenarios and a roadmap for policymakers and business leaders to 2030.  \nBusiness services stand at the heart of Europe’s economic reinvention with the 3Ts – Talent, Technology, and Transformation. Once quiet back-offices and cost centers they’ve become dynamic growth drivers for European economy. \nContinental mosaic \nEurope’s business services industry reflects a wealth of complementary capabilities across regions, building on scale and diversified network. Western and Northern Europe lead in corporate HQs and high-value digital services, while CEE offers substantial capabilities and growing expertise. This interplay fosters diversification, nearshoring, and cross-border collaboration, enabling countries to leverage unique strengths. \nTalent: key differentiator and biggest bottleneck \nWhile leading hubs are thriving, smaller ecosystems face talent shortages, infrastructure deficits and diverse regulatory frameworks. This disparity highlights the urgent need for workforce transformation, as availability of skilled professionals is essential for competitiveness, especially in knowledge-intensive business services. \nDespite challenges, regional diversity within Europe fosters unique opportunities for specialization and scaling, highlighting the necessity of strategic coordination across contexts. \nTransformation trajectory: from classic GBS and GBS 3.0 to GenBS \nEurope leads in knowledge-intensive business services exports (52.6% globally) but lags in AI adoption and service platformization. The report outlines a shift from Global Business Services (GBS) to GBS 3.0 and GenBS in response to challenges. \nClassic GBS focuses on cost savings via labor arbitrage. GBS 3.0 integrates end-to-end processes with automation, analytics, and cloud, emphasizing value creation. GenBS, powered by generative AI, redefines the sector with hyper-automation and platform-based delivery. \nBusiness services as strategic integrators \nWhile undergoing their own transformation, business services are now central to profound changes in six industries key for European competitiveness: banking, pharma, automotive, energy, telecom, and aerospace & defense. They drive cross-sector innovation, support R&D, close talent gaps, and embed governance. Rather than trimming costs, they underpin large-scale digital initiatives and help industries reinvent business models. \nTowards resilient growth: t hree scenarios \nThe ABSL report outlines three scenarios for Europe’s business services industry by 2030: \nEurope stands at a pivotal moment of opportunity. Business services are already one of its strongest champions, driving growth and innovation across the continent. In the next five years Europe can position itself as the world’s leading business services hub and secure sustainable global leadership. Unlocking this potential requires us to embrace change, invest in talent and technology, and make the leap toward Generative Business Services, says Jacek Levernes, Chairman, ABSL. \nABSL Business Services Industry in Europe 2025 report: here \nMedia Contact: [email protected] \nLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2786853/ABSL_LOGO.jpg",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Investor optimism is outpacing weak industrial and retail data, reflecting renewed confidence in China’s long-term trajectory China’s equity markets have staged one of their most powerful rallies in years, adding more than US$3 trillion in value across the mainland and Hong Kong. The CSI 300 has surged around 16% in 2025, with tech indices climbing to their highest levels in a decade. \nRetail investors, flush with savings and encouraged by state liquidity support, are leading the charge. The speed of this advance highlights an optimism that is racing ahead of the current data, but it also signals a deeper confidence in China’s long-term direction. \nIndustrial output growth has slowed and retail sales have fallen short of forecasts, yet investors are looking past these numbers. They are positioning for an economy that is being re-engineered away from property dependence and toward higher-value innovation, advanced manufacturing and green technology. \nThis isn’t the same as previous cycles of speculative fervor. It’s a reflection of belief in structural reform, and that belief is now, it appears, driving capital. \nMomentum in Chinese equities is undeniable. Individual investors dominate trading volumes, with nearly 90% of daily flows coming from households. \nWith savings at a record 160 trillion yuan ($23.5 trillion) and deposit rates sliding, the shift into equities has arguably only just begun. A relatively small reallocation of that capital can fuel significant gains, and Beijing’s encouragement of this process is part of a broader strategy to deepen capital markets. \nIt is true that parts of the market, particularly biotech, research services and some AI-linked firms, look stretched. Prices in those areas reflect assumptions that may not materialize quickly. \nHowever, this doesn’t mean the rally as a whole is unstable. Instead, it shows that capital is searching aggressively for exposure to the sectors that will shape China’s economic future. Temporary overheating is the price of rapid transformation, not proof of a bubble. \nWhat makes this rally different is the visible role of the state. The authorities are not simply standing by while investors speculate. They are directing policy support, opening new channels for foreign participation and signaling long-term commitment to equity markets as a pillar of economic resilience. \nBy widening access to stock options and strengthening market infrastructure, Beijing is laying the groundwork for deeper institutional participation that will make markets more robust over time. \nThis is why dismissing the rally as “disconnected” is too narrow a view. It is better understood as anticipatory — markets are often the first place where faith in reform becomes visible. \nInvestors are voting with capital on the belief that China’s transition will succeed. Should consumption strengthen, productivity improve and private sector confidence revive, today’s valuations will look justified in hindsight. \nThe challenge for global investors is selection. Momentum alone is powerful, but the lasting gains will be found in companies that align with China’s strategic priorities. \nAdvanced manufacturing, green energy and semiconductor development are sectors where government policy, capital investment and long-term global demand intersect. These are also the areas most likely to turn today’s optimism into sustainable earnings. \nStill, caution is advised. Macro data has not yet confirmed a turnaround, and external pressures from trade and geopolitics are real. But volatility should not obscure the broader trajectory. \nChina is deliberately shifting its growth model and the current rally is a sign that investors believe this evolution is not only possible but inevitable. The market, I believe, is not ignoring the economy; rather, it’s looking beyond the short term. \nWhat we’re seeing is capital accelerating ahead of fundamentals, anticipating a future where reforms deliver productivity, innovation and resilience. This is why this surge matters. \nChina’s equity boom is a bet on reform and reinvention. It is not without risk, but it is also not hollow. If policy determination and technological progress translate into results, today’s surge will be remembered as the early stage of a longer transformation, not a fleeting spike.  \nIn short, the rally is a signal that capital believes China’s future story will be stronger than its present. \nThank you for registering! \nAn account was already registered with this email.

               "title": "The Payroll Effect: Turning wage flows into embedded finance opportunities",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Historically, payroll has been viewed as a back-office chore that had to be done, but it was not considered an area for innovation. Now a shift is underway: payroll is emerging as one of the most direct, sticky, and impactful entry points for embedded finance.\n\nBecause it touches nearly every kind of business, from small independents to large enterprises, it serves as a powerful gateway for embedding financial services and delivering fresh value to employers and employees alike.\n\nFinancial firms that once focused solely on lending, payments, or banking as their primary touchpoints are now shifting their attention to payroll. Green Dot, U.S. Bank, and even the remittance-focused player Remitly are each leaning into payroll or payroll-adjacent flows as a way to expand their embedded finance ambitions.\n\n\n\n\nGREEN DOT: TRANSFORMING WAGE PAYMENTS INTO A FINANCIAL HUB\nGreen Dot has been building in the payroll payments space longer than most. The bank launched its rapid! solution in 2004 to streamline wage payments. Two decades later, rapid! has evolved from a payroll card solution into a broader platform connecting payroll with the digital payments ecosystem.\n\nToday, rapid! offers PayCard, earned wage access, and disbursement solutions that serve over 7,000 businesses, covering scheduled paydays but also bonuses, tips, missed pay, and contractor payouts. That breadth matters. By embedding itself into every type of employer-to-worker disbursement, rapid! positions itself as a hub where financial access and operational efficiency intersect.\n\nrapid!’s recent partnership with Workday, a cloud-based enterprise software provider for HR and finance, shows how Green Dot is extending payroll into a larger embedded finance play. Through direct integration, rapid! brings real-time pay and financial wellness tools into everyday workflows for both employers and employees, powered by Green Dot’s proprietary money-movement rails that deliver instant payouts to any US account. For end consumers, that means wage access that feels like table stakes; for Green Dot, it’s a distribution channel into the financial lives of millions of workers.\n\nThat infrastructure is solving for faster payroll but also positioning Green Dot to plug additional embedded services like banking, lending, and savings into the same rails. Payroll becomes the entry point, but the long game is an ecosystem of financial tools embedded directly into workflows.\n\nU.S. BANK: BUNDLING PAYROLL INTO SMB BANKING\nU.S. Bank is taking a slightly different approach, targeting small businesses, which are often burdened by fragmented tools for payroll, banking, and operations. Last month, U.S. Bank and fintech partner Gusto launched a payroll solution that embeds payroll directly into the bank’s digital platform, giving small business owners one place to manage banking, payments, and payroll.\n\nIt’s been a long-standing ask from SMBs, and U.S. Bank’s survey confirms the strong interest: 80% of small business owners indicated a need for digital payroll solutions, and 81% prefer providers that bundle banking and operational tools.\n\nThe benefits of embedding payroll are both practical and strategic. Small business owners gain convenience and compliance support, while the bank strengthens its relationship with one of its core client segments. Payroll here is a recurring, indispensable process that keeps clients inside the U.S. Bank ecosystem, creating opportunities to cross-sell lending, treasury, or expense management solutions.\n\nREMITLY: STABLECOINS AND THE PAYROLL OF THE FUTURE\nKnown primarily for cross-border remittances, Remitly is experimenting with payroll-adjacent flows as part of its embedded finance strategy. The company recently partnered with Circle and Bridge to integrate USDC stablecoins into its wallet, enabling faster, more predictable value movement across borders.\n\nWhile the immediate use case is consumer remittances, Remitly is starting to view stablecoins as an opportunity that extends beyond the consumer use case. The rails could eventually power the firm’s other B2B products, such as Remitly Business and cross-border payroll.\n\n“We’re already piloting this in targeted corridors, demonstrating how stablecoins can extend beyond consumer remittances to become infrastructure for global payroll and cross-border business payments,” noted Ankur Sinha, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Remitly.\n\nThe infrastructure implications could be profound for payroll and global payments. Sinha explained, “The same advantages that make stablecoins compelling for consumers – instant settlement, predictable value, and lower payout costs – are equally powerful for SMBs, marketplaces, and global payroll platforms.”\n\nThe post The Payroll Effect: Turning wage flows into embedded finance opportunities appeared first on Tearsheet.",

Adjacent to the Gateway Arch, with 415 apartments units, Mansion House is one of St. Louis’s most iconic riverfront properties. Renovations to the 1960’s-era building will take less than two years to complete, with fully modernized units being delivered in 2027.

The Fund provided a significantly below-market interest rate. \nThe FHA 221(d)(4) Substantial Rehabilitation loan is a government-insured financing program designed to fund the purchase and major renovation of multifamily rental properties. It provides long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse financing that covers both construction costs and permanent debt in a single loan.\nGershman Investment Corp. is one of the nation’s few independently owned mortgage companies that offer FHA-insured multifamily and healthcare financing.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " NEW YORK, Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Revelio Labs today released its September edition of Revelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS), a monthly data release delivering transparent and reliable insights into the U.S. labor market. Their numbers show employment gains of 60 thousand for September, a reading that came in just above expectations but continues to reflect a broad slowdown in the labor market. \nIn terms of leading indicators, active job postings declined by 0.6% month-over-month, while salaries from new job postings decreased by 0.3%. Both hiring and attrition rates also fell by 0.1 percentage points, pointing to continued weakening in labor market dynamism. \nWith the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) unable to publish its official jobs report due to the government shutdown, RPLS provides a critical alternative view of labor market dynamics. Using a regression model built on historical correlations with both RPLS and ADP data, Revelio Labs estimates that the BLS would have reported approximately 38 thousand jobs gained in September. \n”While our RPLS September employment gains number came in slightly above expectations, it is still a relatively small gain. Together with declines in job postings, advertised salaries, hiring, and attrition, these suggest the labor market continues to slow down. With the BLS sidelined this month, independent measures like RPLS are essential to provide clarity.”, said Chief Economist Lisa Simon. \nRPLS is a freely available macroeconomic labor market set of statistics built from 100+ million U.S. profiles to provide a clear view of workforce dynamics. It follows a format similar to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), tracking employment levels, wages, and job transitions at a scale that traditional surveys cannot, offering a continuous picture of the labor market. RPLS intends to close the growing information gap and deliver unbiased data on the U.S. workforce for policymakers, businesses, and the public. \nSeptember 2025 Release Highlights \nView the full Revelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS) data release and charts at https://www.reveliolabs.com/public-labor-statistics/ \nChanges in employment by sector (in thousands) \nSalaries from new job postings by sector \nWhat data sources are used? \nPowered by a dataset representing close to the whole population of employed people in the United States, Revelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS) draws from 100+ million U.S. profiles that mirror the national workforce and cover two-thirds of all employed individuals, compared to an estimated 27% from the BLS establishment survey and 0.03% from the BLS household survey. \nWhat metrics are covered? \nRevelio Public Labor Statistics (RPLS) will publish (a) total nonfarm employment, (b) job openings (c) employee hiring and attrition rates, and (d) salaries from new openings. All metrics are available by occupation (SOC 2-digit), sector (NAICS 2-digit), and state. \nAbout Revelio Labs \nRevelio Labs is an industry leader in workforce intelligence.

               "title": "Will AI Crash The Economy?",
               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": "Will AI Crash The Economy?\nby Tyler Durden\nAuthored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,\nThe lines of dominoes being toppled run through every nook and cranny of the economy.\nAs we all know, the problem with euphoria is the inevitable collision with reality and the resulting disillusionment. But wait--it gets worse.\nThe new love of your life, your savior who is going to make everything right again, is not just impossibly flawed--they’re a con artist. Now that really hurts. They not only stole your heart, they stole your money.\nWhich brings us to the AI Boom / Bubble. The euphoria is literally immeasurable, but the disconnect from reality is easily visible and can be broken down into measurable bits:\n1. AI revenues are orders of magnitude lighter than the sums being invested (capex, i.e. capital investment). The euphoria is based on the idea that revenues will catch up, but the second date is raising doubts about Prince Charming’s non-flim-flammed revenues and prospects.\nThis report has raised eyebrows, and the real question is: OK, so let’s say it underestimates revenues by 50%. That means we’re at 3% of revenues needed to justify the capex rather than 2%. Maybe this is why Prince Charming invites his amour to poorly lit bistros--he’s had, um, work done and he’s wary of bright lighting.\n$2 trillion in new revenue needed to fund AI’s scaling trend  (Bain & Company)\n2. AI tools are inherently untrustworthy and lend themselves to generating ”going through the motions” slop that gives the superficial appearance of value but actually has negative value as it’s incomplete, misleading and/or incoherent. Sorting the wheat from the chaff actually takes more time because AI is so adept at generating a superficial gloss. In other words, AI generates time sinks rather than productivity.\nPeople Overtrust AI-Generated Medical Advice despite Low Accuracy .\nAdd in that AI slop looks similar to authentic research and that AI tools have a measurable preference for AI-generated content (i.e. AI slop), and we have a toxic cocktail of untrustworthy output.\n3. The rate at which major companies are adopting AI is rolling over. This chart reflects the peak of euphoria has been reached by those with the most resources to figure that out and the real-world utility of AI tools is yet to be determined.\nThe claim making the rounds is that it’s not Prince Charming’s fault that he’s disappointed his enamored amour; she’s making unrealistic demands on poor PC. In other words, it’s the companies’ fault that AI is underperforming. Is this the great promise of AI, to blame the mark and not the con-artist?\n4. AI data centers are competing with other users for electricity, water and capital. The apologists’ claim is that AI data centers are only a tiny little straw sipping on the grid’s total energy, but this overlooks that price is set on the margins and demand for electricity and water by those with unlimited bank accounts will push prices up at rates far above the total additional consumption of AI data centers.\nThis reality is reflected anecdotally in household complaints that their utility bills have shot up from $250 to $800 a month. Yes, there are other factors at work--the need to invest in grid upgrades, higher insurance rates for catastrophic weather events, etc., but to ignore AI data centers’ insatiable demand for water and electricity is like seeing Prince Charming palm your wallet and then making excuses for him.\nHow Can We Meet AI’s Insatiable Demand for Compute Power?  (Bain & Company)\nBy all means fact-check that 60% of Santa Clara’s electricity goes to AI data centers: I did. It’s true.\nThis is not to say there isn’t a use-case for AI. The point here is the excesses of capital and resources heedlessly thrown at AI in the frenzy of euphoria will crash the economy. I know it seems like there are endless trillions to toss around, but back in the real world, capital isn’t infinite, and capital squandered in mal-investments that have little to no real return is capital that could have been invested more productively elsewhere.\nThe same is true for water and electricity / energy. These resources are not infinite, and when someone with a bottomless bank account enters the market, prices will rise, which means consumers will be devoting scarce income to utilities, leaving them less to spend on other goods and services.\nCompanies spending scarce capital on AI will be forced to assess the actual financial costs and return on capital invested, and they will pull back. This retrenchment will reverse the parabolic rise of spending on AI, and that will deflate the AI Bubble that has inflated the entire stock market into a euphoric bubble that has now exceeded the extreme euphoria of the dot-com era bubble that popped 25 years ago.\nSo will AI crash the economy? Malinvestment on an unprecedented scale, disappointing revenues, soaring costs for utilities stripping discretionary income from consumers and the inevitable reversal of investment euphoria and the crash of stock market bubbles bursting--these are not drivers of positive economic development.\nOnce the stock market euphoria bursts, the wealth effect reverses, and since people feel poorer (and are poorer), they slash borrowing and spending. Those who’ve maxed out their credit have no choice: stop paying the car loan or rent to keep the lights on.\nOne domino falling, OK, no big deal. This is different: the lines of dominoes being toppled run through every nook and cranny of the economy. What’s been untouchable will be touched--by a hammer.\n*  *  *",

               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " SINGAPORE, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Davis Commodities Limited (Nasdaq: DTCK) announced today that it is reviewing a proposed multi-layered “commodity treasury” framework connected to its Real Yield Token (RYT) initiative. This model is designed to explore how tokenized agricultural reserves, commodity futures, and programmable settlement rails could collectively scale into a multi-billion-dollar liquidity backbone for global agri-finance. \nModeling a $2.5 Billion Digital Commodity Reserve \nPreliminary internal scenarios, subject to regulatory and market validation, suggest the following potential outcomes: \nWhat Is a “Commodity Treasury”? \nA “commodity treasury” is a structured pool of tokenized reserves—such as warehoused sugar, rice, or sustainable oil inventories—linked to yield-bearing digital assets. This programmable liquidity buffer acts as a backstop for cross-border settlement, hedging, and ESG-linked financing, enhancing transparency and capital efficiency for both institutional and retail ecosystems. \nEcosystem & ESG Synergies \nThe proposed treasury model could embed recognized sustainability certifications (e.g., ISCC, Bonsucro) directly into tokenized reserves. By doing so, the system may enable impact funds, sustainability-linked institutional investors, and regional trade financiers to access verified, traceable, commodity-backed yield instruments at scale. \nTokenized treasuries are attracting global attention, as traditional financial institutions and fintech leaders increasingly evaluate on-chain reserve frameworks to improve transparency and efficiency. Davis Commodities’ exploration aligns with these market developments, focusing on emerging-market trade corridors that are often underserved by conventional capital systems. \nExecutive Commentary \n“We are studying how real commodities, digital yield architecture, and programmable settlement can converge into a capital-efficient treasury system,” said Ms. Li Peng Leck, Executive Chairwoman of Davis Commodities. “Our intent is to model a scalable backbone that could support both institutional hedging and retail-driven ecosystems in emerging markets—linking verified supply chains with next-generation capital flows.” \nNext Steps \nThe treasury framework is currently under review in collaboration with ESG auditors, blockchain infrastructure providers, and cross-border liquidity specialists. No implementation commitments have been made at this stage. Any pilot or launch will remain subject to regulatory consultation, market readiness, and stakeholder feedback. \nAbout Davis Commodities Limited \nBased in Singapore, Davis Commodities Limited is an agricultural commodity trading company that specializes in trading sugar, rice, and oil and fat products in various markets, including Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
