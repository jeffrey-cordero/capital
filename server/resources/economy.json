               "text": " Finance professional announces 2026 candidacy for Vermilion County treasurer \nDANVILLE — Finance professional Jason Whaling announced Friday that he plans to run for Vermilion County treasurer in the November 2026 election. \nCurrent Republican Treasurer Darren Duncan has also picked up a petitions to seek re-election. \n“Vermilion County is my home,” Whaling said. “I’ve spent years helping families here build financial stability, and I want to bring that same focus to protecting our public funds and serving our community with transparency and care.” \nHe said he has spent almost 30 years in real estate and finance, helping many families become homeowners. He’s worked at First Savings Bank (now called The Hometown Savings Bank) and is currently at Fisher National Bank. \n“My goal has always been to set homeowners up for success — not just today, but for the long haul,” Whaling said. \nWhaling said as treasurer, he wants to modernize how Vermilion County manages its finances, diversify its investments, safeguard public funds and bring greater transparency to financial reporting. \n“Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going and to trust that it’s being handled responsibly,” Whaling said. “I’ll work to ensure Vermilion County’s finances are stable, secure and well-managed.” \nWhaling has lived in Vermilion County since 2013. He’s been involved with various organizations, including being a two-term president of the Danville Sunrise Rotary Club and vice president of the Habitat for Humanity of Danville executive board. He also serves on Crosspoint Human Services’ finance committee. \nIn addition, Whaling has had leadership roles with Scouting America. \n“This community is where I’ve built my career, raised my family and committed my time,” he said. “Serving as treasurer would be an extension of that commitment — to protect what matters and help Vermilion County thrive.”",

               "text": "The U.S. economy is showing a stark divide between wealthier households and the middle class. While stock gains and rising real estate values are boosting prosperity for the affluent, many middle- and lower-income Americans are struggling to keep up. Consumer confidence has declined sharply since the summer, with households earning less than six figures scaling back on spending. Shoppers are increasingly visiting dollar stores, filling lighter carts at major retailers like Walmart, and trading down at stores such as Kohl’s.Economists describe the current situation as a two-tiered economy. Wealthier Americans enjoy continued financial growth, while middle- and lower-income households face shrinking savings, inflation pressures, and concerns about job security. Many feel the traditional middle class is disappearing, leaving a widening gap between those who have plenty and those who have very little.Experts say government intervention could play a role in easing the pressure. Policies aimed at controlling inflation, boosting wages, and creating jobs could help restore confidence and strengthen the middle class. Without such measures, the financial divide may continue to widen, leaving many Americans feeling excluded from the so-called economic recovery.Overall, the current economy highlights a growing tension: prosperity exists, but it is not evenly distributed. For millions of Americans, daily financial concerns remain, illustrating that overall economic growth does not always translate to widespread financial security.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " A shopper carries a Puma store bag in New York on September 6. \nMichael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nAmericans hate this economy, but they keep spending like they love it. \nThe Commerce Department reported Friday that consumer spending rose 0.6% in August. Although that may not sound like a lot, it represented significantly stronger growth than economists had expected. \nThe report wasn’t an outlier: Retail sales also rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said in a separate report two weeks ago. Corporate earnings and sales have proven resilient in the past quarter, with many companies saying customers continue to give them business despite concerns about a flagging economy. And a revised report issued Thursday on the second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of US economic growth, showed that GDP grew by the fastest rate in almost two years, buoyed by strong consumer spending. \nStill, this economy’s ratings are in the toilet. The University of Michigan reported Friday that consumer sentiment fell to an index level of 55.1, the seventh-lowest reading dating back to 1952. That’s unsurprising considering prices keep creeping higher, giving Americans PTSD from the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent prices soaring during the middle of former President Joe Biden’s term. \nAmericans consistently rate the economy as the most important issue for the country, according to CNN polling conducted by SSRS. And as prices keep rising – the annual inflation rate rose to 2.9% in August, the highest since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this month – their opinion about the economy is sinking fast. \nNot helping: President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Despite polling showing tariffs are his lowest-rated issue – by far – Trump continues to double down on his extraordinary trade policy. On Thursday, Trump announced new tariffs on drugs, furniture, trucks and cabinets. And he promised more are on the way. Recent consumer price reports have shown that his tariffs are in part to blame for inflation’s slow but steady rebound. \nAlso not helping: Hiring has come to a standstill. America actually lost jobs in June, the first time that happened in any month since December 2020. \nAnd yet, America’s economy keeps humming along. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tool predicts that the US economy will expand at an annual rate near 4% this quarter, which ends Tuesday – a stunning achievement considering the toxic mix of slow hiring, rising prices, high interest rates and lackluster consumer sentiment. \nWhat’s keeping the economy going \nHow can the economy get such terrible grades even as it’s growing at such a strong pace? \nPart of the answer is “vibes,” that oft-used and nebulous term that was used to describe similar consumer behavior during the recent inflation crisis. Despite record-low consumer sentiment (just below today’s moribund levels), people kept spending their way through 2022 and 2023 like it was nothing. Jobs were plentiful. People still had plenty of pandemic-era savings stored up. So they dialed back on discretionary purchases (everyone already fixed up their home and bought a treadmill during the pandemic, anyway), but they kept buying the stuff they needed. \nThat’s why the term “vibecession” became a go-to for economists during the Biden years: The economy felt like it stunk, but it actually was doing just fine. \nThere are elements of that this time around. The economic data may be headed in the wrong direction, but it’s still relatively strong. Inflation is rising, but it’s gaining quite slowly and is nowhere near the 9.1% annual rate from 2022 – a four-decade high. Job growth is slowing, but it’s still growing, and unemployment remains historically low. And many Americans still have pandemic-era ultra-low mortgage rates to help them weather price increases. \n“Downbeat sentiment stands in stark contrast to encouraging hard data,” said Oren Klachkin, economist at Nationwide Financial Markets. “Even though they feel negative, consumers continue to spend. We put more stock in the hard than soft data.” \nAnother reason for bad grades in a good economy: Wealthier Americans are doing just fine, while people with fewer means are struggling. Economists call it a “K-shaped” economy. \nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this month commented on that phenomenon and why the bifurcation can help the economy in aggregate, even if many people are struggling. \n“Consumer spending numbers were well above expectations, and that may well be skewed toward higher earning consumers. There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that,” Powell said. “Nonetheless, it’s spending. So I think the economy is moving along.” \nRegardless of the reasons, the fact that consumers are still willing to spend is undoubtedly good news: America’s GDP is more than two-thirds comprised of consumer spending. As long as people keep shelling out, America’s massive and diverse economy will keep running just fine. \nWhy the economy could stop humming \nOf course, recessions happen sometimes. And there are plenty of warning signs coming from all parts of the US economy. \nHiring has been in a yearlong slump, and monthly job gains recently fell below the amount needed to keep up with America’s population gain. The Black unemployment rate has surged in recent months – often a precursor to more broad-based layoffs. If job growth turns into job losses, America’s economy could turn on a dime. \nA looming government shutdown threatens to upset the economic balance as well – particularly if the Trump administration makes good on its threat to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs that would be furloughed. \nThere is some reason to suspect that spending may have been artificially boosted in recent months. For example, August is a back-to-school month, when many people have little choice but to spend. The next few months could get ugly if consumer sentiment continues to slump and Americans opt to rein in their spending. \n“Consumers are becoming less uncertain about the path of future inflation, but many expect higher prices,” said Klachkin. “Alongside slower income growth and high prices and interest rates, this should contribute to a moderation in consumer spending growth.” \nMany Americans are shelling out on their credit cards and buy-now-pay-later loans, which carry astronomical interest rates. Credit scores last year fell at the fastest pace since the Great Recession as the cost of living rose and long-paused student debt payments restarted. \nMeanwhile, stocks continue to surge to record highs, giving investors a strong sense of invincibility. But stocks are at another record high: their relative price compared to companies’ sales and profit expectations. That suggests the market has gotten seriously expensive and may be in an AI-induced bubble that could be close to bursting. \nTariffs continue to pose a threat to the economy, too. Despite relatively low inflation after Trump imposed historic tariffs, businesses may soon need to pass along more of their added costs to consumers. \nRecent producer prices reports show that wholesalers are absorbing much of the tariff costs, but their profit margins are getting significantly squeezed. Citi economist Nathan Sheets estimated that consumers have borne only about 30% to 40% of the cost of tariffs, and that balance could soon shift as company shareholders demand profit growth.",

               "text": " A shopper carries a Puma store bag in New York on September 6. \nMichael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nAmericans hate this economy, but they keep spending like they love it. \nThe Commerce Department reported Friday that consumer spending rose 0.6% in August. Although that may not sound like a lot, it represented significantly stronger growth than economists had expected. \nThe report wasn’t an outlier: Retail sales also rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said in a separate report two weeks ago. Corporate earnings and sales have proven resilient in the past quarter, with many companies saying customers continue to give them business despite concerns about a flagging economy. And a revised report issued Thursday on the second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of US economic growth, showed that GDP grew by the fastest rate in almost two years, buoyed by strong consumer spending. \nStill, this economy’s ratings are in the toilet. The University of Michigan reported Friday that consumer sentiment fell to an index level of 55.1, the seventh-lowest reading dating back to 1952. That’s unsurprising considering prices keep creeping higher, giving Americans PTSD from the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent prices soaring during the middle of former President Joe Biden’s term. \nAmericans consistently rate the economy as the most important issue for the country, according to CNN polling conducted by SSRS. And as prices keep rising – the annual inflation rate rose to 2.9% in August, the highest since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this month – their opinion about the economy is sinking fast. \nNot helping: President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Despite polling showing tariffs are his lowest-rated issue – by far – Trump continues to double down on his extraordinary trade policy. On Thursday, Trump announced new tariffs on drugs, furniture, trucks and cabinets. And he promised more are on the way. Recent consumer price reports have shown that his tariffs are in part to blame for inflation’s slow but steady rebound. \nAlso not helping: Hiring has come to a standstill. America actually lost jobs in June, the first time that happened in any month since December 2020. \nAnd yet, America’s economy keeps humming along. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tool predicts that the US economy will expand at an annual rate near 4% this quarter, which ends Tuesday – a stunning achievement considering the toxic mix of slow hiring, rising prices, high interest rates and lackluster consumer sentiment. \nWhat’s keeping the economy going \nHow can the economy get such terrible grades even as it’s growing at such a strong pace? \nPart of the answer is “vibes,” that oft-used and nebulous term that was used to describe similar consumer behavior during the recent inflation crisis. Despite record-low consumer sentiment (just below today’s moribund levels), people kept spending their way through 2022 and 2023 like it was nothing. Jobs were plentiful. People still had plenty of pandemic-era savings stored up. So they dialed back on discretionary purchases (everyone already fixed up their home and bought a treadmill during the pandemic, anyway), but they kept buying the stuff they needed. \nThat’s why the term “vibecession” became a go-to for economists during the Biden years: The economy felt like it stunk, but it actually was doing just fine. \nThere are elements of that this time around. The economic data may be headed in the wrong direction, but it’s still relatively strong. Inflation is rising, but it’s gaining quite slowly and is nowhere near the 9.1% annual rate from 2022 – a four-decade high. Job growth is slowing, but it’s still growing, and unemployment remains historically low. And many Americans still have pandemic-era ultra-low mortgage rates to help them weather price increases. \n“Downbeat sentiment stands in stark contrast to encouraging hard data,” said Oren Klachkin, economist at Nationwide Financial Markets. “Even though they feel negative, consumers continue to spend. We put more stock in the hard than soft data.” \nAnother reason for bad grades in a good economy: Wealthier Americans are doing just fine, while people with fewer means are struggling. Economists call it a “K-shaped” economy. \nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this month commented on that phenomenon and why the bifurcation can help the economy in aggregate, even if many people are struggling. \n“Consumer spending numbers were well above expectations, and that may well be skewed toward higher earning consumers. There’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that,” Powell said. “Nonetheless, it’s spending. So I think the economy is moving along.” \nRegardless of the reasons, the fact that consumers are still willing to spend is undoubtedly good news: America’s GDP is more than two-thirds comprised of consumer spending. As long as people keep shelling out, America’s massive and diverse economy will keep running just fine. \nWhy the economy could stop humming \nOf course, recessions happen sometimes. And there are plenty of warning signs coming from all parts of the US economy. \nHiring has been in a yearlong slump, and monthly job gains recently fell below the amount needed to keep up with America’s population gain. The Black unemployment rate has surged in recent months – often a precursor to more broad-based layoffs. If job growth turns into job losses, America’s economy could turn on a dime. \nA looming government shutdown threatens to upset the economic balance as well – particularly if the Trump administration makes good on its threat to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs that would be furloughed. \nThere is some reason to suspect that spending may have been artificially boosted in recent months. For example, August is a back-to-school month, when many people have little choice but to spend. The next few months could get ugly if consumer sentiment continues to slump and Americans opt to rein in their spending. \n“Consumers are becoming less uncertain about the path of future inflation, but many expect higher prices,” said Klachkin. “Alongside slower income growth and high prices and interest rates, this should contribute to a moderation in consumer spending growth.” \nMany Americans are shelling out on their credit cards and buy-now-pay-later loans, which carry astronomical interest rates. Credit scores last year fell at the fastest pace since the Great Recession as the cost of living rose and long-paused student debt payments restarted. \nMeanwhile, stocks continue to surge to record highs, giving investors a strong sense of invincibility. But stocks are at another record high: their relative price compared to companies’ sales and profit expectations. That suggests the market has gotten seriously expensive and may be in an AI-induced bubble that could be close to bursting. \nTariffs continue to pose a threat to the economy, too. Despite relatively low inflation after Trump imposed historic tariffs, businesses may soon need to pass along more of their added costs to consumers. \nRecent producer prices reports show that wholesalers are absorbing much of the tariff costs, but their profit margins are getting significantly squeezed.

Companies and households continue to order big-ticket items while inflation has been relatively soft. Even housing showed signs of life, with new sales hitting a three-year high in August.\nPreviously, such trends had been powered by trillions in stimulus from both congressional spending and low interest rates and liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve.\nBut the narrative now is shifting towards the ever-popular wealth effect coming from Wall Street and a succession of new highs in major stock indexes despite lofty valuations.\nwatch now\nSquawk on the Street\n”I do think that goes to the bounce in the stock market and the wealth effect,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said Friday on CNBC. ”I think all of the spending is coming from the well-to-do high-income high-net-worth households that are seeing their stock portfolios are up and they’re feeling a lot better off and they’re spending.”\nIndeed, the market has seen a stair-step climb higher this year, boosted by massive AI spending, no doubt, but also rallying thanks to strength in big industrial companies and communications giants. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 9%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is up 23%.\nStock Chart Icon\nStock chart icon\nDow and Nasdaq\nConsumers are almost always happier when stocks are up and unemployment is low, as is currently the case. However, sentiment this year as measured by the University of Michigan has been in a steady decline, falling 23% since January when President Donald Trump took office.\nA double-edged sword\nThe Michigan gauge fell 5.3% in September, though survey Director Joanne Hsu noted an anomaly: ”Sentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased.”\nThat makes sense considering the stock market has set a succession of new records this month. Being that the top 10% of earners in the U.S. own 87% of the market, according to St. Louis Fed data , asset holders have reason to be pleased.\nThat’s also, according to Zandi, a reason why the economic strength could be built on sand.\n”The economy’s very vulnerable if the stock market does turn south, for whatever reason,” he said. ”People start seeing red on their screens and not green on their screens and the savings rate goes up not down. In the current context of no job growth, that’s recession.”\nConcerns over the stock market primarily focus on valuations, with the S&P 500\ncurrently trading at 22.5 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, well above both the five- (19.9) and 10-year (18.6) trends, according to FactSet.\nFor all that, recent economic data indicates few recession pressures.\nConsumer spending in August increased 0.6%, according to Commerce Department numbers released Friday that were better than expected. Spending adjusted for inflation rose 0.4%, indicating consumers are still able to weather price increases.\nOn inflation, the annual rate is still well in excess of the Fed’s 2% target, with core holding at 2.9%. But monthly increases are about in line with previous trends and Wall Street forecasts, putting the Fed on target almost certainly for an October rate cut and perhaps another when it meets again in December.\n”The economy has continued to surprise to the upside and despite the negativity captured in surveys and expressed by commentators, actions speak louder than words and consumers continue to spend, which is why corporate profits continue to exceed expectations,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.\nMore good news, more danger\nThere was other good economic news this week as well.\nGross domestic product grew at a 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, according to a revision Thursday that was half a percentage point higher than previously thought. Again, the reason for the upside surprise was because consumer spending was considerably stronger than the prior estimate. Moreover, the Atlanta Fed raised its GDP tracking estimate for the third quarter, pushing the expected growth rate up to 3.9%, or 0.6 percentage point higher than the last update a week ago.\nAlso, durable goods orders unexpectedly increased while new home sales surged 20%. All that came as a rise in jobless claims a couple weeks ago turned out to be a blip, with layoffs remaining low, though payroll growth has also been static at best.\nEven if it’s primarily consumers at the top end driving the growth, the macroeconomic numbers are at the very least telling a story of stability.\n”Often, when people feel pessimistic about the near-future economy, they begin reigning in spending, but that hasn’t been the case thus far,” said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer site NerdWallet. ”In fact, the strength of the consumer is credited with keeping the economy strong for the past handful of years, despite high inflation, high [interest] rates and great uncertainty.”\nHowever, Renter also noted the knife’s edge that the economy sits on, with a broad swath of consumers not joining the stock market party and thus feeling down, and overall sentiment levels consistent with recessions.\n”Wealth provides some insulation from perceived economic volatility, and investors have been largely doing OK,” she said. ”Consumers are attuned to the current economic risks — inflation and labor market weakness. This could be due to first-hand experiences — food prices rose significantly last month — or because they’re on edge from headlines tracking key economic data. In any case, people aren’t feeling great about the economy, their place within it or where it’s all headed.”\nwatch now\nVIDEO3:3603:36\nFormer Cleveland Fed President Mester on August PCE data: This isn’t really good news for the Fed",

Travel booked through advisers — which includes accommodation, flights and activities — is expected to hit $141.3 billion next year in the U.S., equal to 26% of the total market, the American Society of Travel Advisors estimates.\n“Curation and support are the main selling points,” that distinguish in-person advice from online services or AI booking options, said Eric Hrubant, founder of New York City-based CIRE Travel, in an interview. Hrubant, 48, said he gets about three emails each week from people asking what it’s like to be a travel agent, and whether there are entry-level jobs available at CIRE.\n“I’m thinking about developing my own coaching business,” he joked.\nHrubant said some of his ultra-high net worth clients easily spend in excess of six figures on personal travel annually, while the average couple he books for spends around $40,000 per year on two weeklong vacations.\nFor Amira Bixby, 58, the catalyst for switching careers came during the pandemic. After almost three decades on Wall Street as an equity sales trader, Bixby realized while working from home that it was the first time in years that she’d been in the house when her children woke up. When her employer called everyone back into the office five days a week, she knew it was time to make a change.\nTravel was an obvious choice. “I was a luxury travel adviser before I was a luxury travel adviser,” said Bixby, who said she would regularly help friends and clients plan trips, and organized for her daughter’s travel lacrosse team to stay at a Four Seasons hotel each season.\nShe values her newfound flexibility above everything else.\n“When you can work from anywhere your life changes drastically for the better,” she said. “My son just graduated from UVA and you can imagine all the parties. I was in UVA four out of six weekends. Before that, I was skiing in the Dolomites,” the mountain range in Italy.\nAlmost anyone can set themselves up as a travel adviser, though some U.S. states do require agents to register and apply for accreditation. Many new agents will take online courses to boost their credentials, and can join established travel networks to get access to insider deals at top hotels, airlines and tour operators.\nWhile some agents charge a fee, the majority of their earnings come through commissions from hotels or tour operators on services booked for customers. Commissions can fluctuate depending on the service, but for some of the biggest brands advisers usually get around 10% of the value of the booking.\nThe amount that vacationers spend with travel agents also varies widely by agency. A survey of ASTA advisers from 2024 found that the biggest proportion of clients spent between $100 and $400 per person, per night with their travel planners. At those rates, a weeklong trip for a couple would range from $1,400 to $5,600.\nLisa Tucker, a law professor in Philadelphia, started working with a travel agent about a year ago to plan vacations for her and her four children. In April, a getaway to Rome was disrupted by an overzealous party in the boutique hotel where they were staying, and the front desk insisted no other rooms were available. Then her travel agent intervened.\n“He made one phone call and suddenly they moved us into the presidential suite,” Tucker, 57, said.\nNot everyone who makes the switch to a career in travel planning increases their earnings — at least not at first. Julia Flood, a former litigation lawyer in Toronto, knew she’d be making less when she stepped away from her job to become a travel agent.

Travel booked through advisers — which includes accommodation, flights and activities — is expected to hit $141.3 billion next year in the U.S., equal to 26% of the total market, the American Society of Travel Advisors estimates.\n\n“Curation and support are the main selling points,” that distinguish in-person advice from online services or AI booking options, said Eric Hrubant, founder of New York City-based CIRE Travel, in an interview. Hrubant, 48, said he gets about three emails each week from people asking what it’s like to be a travel agent, and whether there are entry-level jobs available at CIRE.\n\n“I’m thinking about developing my own coaching business,” he joked.\n\nHrubant said some of his ultra-high net worth clients easily spend in excess of six figures on personal travel annually, while the average couple he books for spends around $40,000 per year on two weeklong vacations.\n\nFor Amira Bixby, 58, the catalyst for switching careers came during the pandemic. After almost three decades on Wall Street as an equity sales trader, Bixby realized while working from home that it was the first time in years that she’d been in the house when her children woke up. When her employer called everyone back into the office five days a week, she knew it was time to make a change.\n\nTravel was an obvious choice. “I was a luxury travel adviser before I was a luxury travel adviser,” said Bixby, who said she would regularly help friends and clients plan trips, and organized for her daughter’s travel lacrosse team to stay at a Four Seasons hotel each season.\n\nShe values her newfound flexibility above everything else.\n\n“When you can work from anywhere your life changes drastically for the better,” she said. “My son just graduated from UVA and you can imagine all the parties. I was in UVA four out of six weekends. Before that, I was skiing in the Dolomites,” the mountain range in Italy.\n\nAlmost anyone can set themselves up as a travel adviser, though some U.S. states do require agents to register and apply for accreditation. Many new agents will take online courses to boost their credentials, and can join established travel networks to get access to insider deals at top hotels, airlines and tour operators.\n\nWhile some agents charge a fee, the majority of their earnings come through commissions from hotels or tour operators on services booked for customers. Commissions can fluctuate depending on the service, but for some of the biggest brands advisers usually get around 10% of the value of the booking.\n\nThe amount that vacationers spend with travel agents also varies widely by agency. A survey of ASTA advisers from 2024 found that the biggest proportion of clients spent between $100 and $400 per person, per night with their travel planners. At those rates, a weeklong trip for a couple would range from $1,400 to $5,600.\n\nLisa Tucker, a law professor in Philadelphia, started working with a travel agent about a year ago to plan vacations for her and her four children. In April, a getaway to Rome was disrupted by an overzealous party in the boutique hotel where they were staying, and the front desk insisted no other rooms were available.

               "site_type": "general",
               "text": " Stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—are no longer fringe experiments but mainstream contenders reshaping global payments and finance. Citigroup‘s report, “Web3 to Wall Street: Stablecoins 2030,” released by the bank’s Citi Institute Global Perspectives and Solutions team, delivers an updated and optimistic blueprint for their trajectory. \nAuthored by a cadre of Citi experts including Sophia Bantanidis, Ronak Shah, and Ronit Ghose, with insights from PwC, Circle, and the Solana Foundation, the 50-page analysis revises earlier projections upward, painting stablecoins as a $1.9 trillion powerhouse by decade’s end. \nStablecoin supply has surged from $200 billion at the start of 2025 to $280 billion by September, fueled by crypto-native ecosystems, e-commerce integrations, and international demand for USD exposure. \nTransaction volumes have exploded, with daily activity rivaling major payment rails. \n“Stablecoins are the bridge from Web3 innovation to Wall Street infrastructure,” the authors assert, emphasizing their role in a broader “on-chain money” ecosystem that includes tokenized bank deposits. \nThis evolution, they argue, is propelled by regulatory tailwinds and technological maturation, positioning stablecoins to capture a slice of the $100 trillion-plus global payments market. \nCentral to the report’s findings are revised market size estimates for 2030. In the base case, stablecoin issuance hits $1.9 trillion—up from Citi’s prior $1.6 trillion forecast—while a bull scenario climbs to $4 trillion and a bear case lingers at $900 billion. \nThese figures stem from a breakdown of demand drivers: 45% from reallocating short-term liquidity into yield-bearing on-chain assets, 40% from crypto market expansion, and 15% from substituting physical banknotes in emerging economies. \nAt a conservative 50x velocity—mirroring fiat payment rails—this could unleash $100 trillion in annual transactions in the base case, ballooning to $200 trillion in the bull run. \nFor context, that’s comparable to the entire global M2 money supply today. \nWhat ignites this growth? The report spotlights “Why Now?” catalysts: the U.S. GENIUS Act, which clarifies stablecoin oversight and fosters innovation; Europe’s MiCAR framework; and emerging licenses in Hong Kong (slated for Q1 2026), the UAE, UK, and Japan. \nThese regimes prioritize monetary sovereignty, ensuring USD stablecoins maintain ~90% dominance while curbing illicit finance. Institutional adoption is another accelerator—think JPMorgan’s Onyx, Visa’s USDC settlements, and PayPal’s PYUSD. \nNew layer-1 blockchains like Solana enhance scalability, while tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like bonds and funds demand stablecoin collateral. \nCorporates, from Walmart to Amazon, are eyeing proprietary issuances for treasury efficiency, potentially disrupting traditional FX hedging. \nUse cases abound, evolving from crypto trading and DeFi to real-world applications. \nStablecoins excel in remittances (slashing 6% fees to near-zero), B2B cross-border payments for SMEs, and real-time treasury management. \nThe report envisions them as settlement layers for capital markets, where a $10 trillion tokenized asset ecosystem by 2030 requires liquid on-chain dollars. Bank tokens—digitized deposits—could even outpace stablecoins, with projected volumes of $100-140 trillion, blending blockchain speed with regulatory trust. \nYet, challenges loom large. \nRisks include deposit disintermediation, where yields lure savers from banks; currency substitution in emerging markets, eroding local fiat; and volatility in capital flows that complicates central bank inflation controls. \nFragmentation across chains, scalability bottlenecks, and privacy shortfalls on public ledgers are hurdles, though solutions like zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 rollups offer promise. \n“No one size fits all,” the authors note, contrasting permissionless stablecoins’ speed with permissioned bank tokens’ compliance. \nCitigroup’s recommendations urge stakeholders to act: Regulators should harmonize rules without stifling innovation; banks, integrate stablecoins into core systems; and corporates, pilot on-chain treasuries. \nFor investors, the bull case signals a trillion-dollar opportunity in infrastructure plays. \nAs Web3 meets Wall Street, stablecoins aren’t just providing stablility—they’re playing a key role in shaping digital finance. \nBy 2030, they could redefine money’s overall usage, accessibility, and borders, heralding an era where digital dollars flow as fast as information.",

               "text": " As the supporter of Latin America’s leading economic contributor, the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) is charting a transformative course for the financial sector in the South American nation of Brazil. \nRecent announcements underscore this evolution: a reflective celebration of five years of Open Finance and the release of the 2025 Responsible and Inclusive System (RIS) Report. \nThese developments signal a shift toward an open, intelligent, and citizen-centered financial ecosystem—one that prioritizes accessibility, sustainability, and innovation over traditional gatekeeping. \nThe Open Finance initiative, launched in 2020, has reached a pivotal moment. \nRoberto Campos Neto, the BCB’s Governor, was succeeded in early 2025 by Gabriel Galípolo, a seasoned economist with a track record in fintech regulation. \nUnder Galípolo’s leadership, the BCB marked the occasion with a resounding declaration: \n“The future of finance has begun—open, intelligent, and citizen-centered.” \nThis vision encapsulates the profound changes Open Finance has wrought in just half a decade. \nOpen Finance, Brazil’s flagship open banking framework, enables the secure sharing of financial data among institutions with user consent. \nWhat started as an experiment has seemingly turned into a thriving ecosystem. \nOver 30 million Brazilians now actively participate, with data-sharing agreements spanning more than 800 financial institutions. \nThis interoperability has democratized access to services previously reserved for the elite. \nLow-income users, for instance, can now aggregate their fragmented accounts—from digital wallets to microloans—into personalized dashboards, unlocking tailored credit products that were once out of reach. \nKey achievements highlight the initiative’s impact. \nTransaction volumes through open APIs have surged by over 400% since inception, fostering innovations like embedded finance in e-commerce platforms and AI-driven financial advisors. \nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) have benefited immensely; a BCB study shows a 25% uptick in credit approvals for underserved borrowers, thanks to richer data insights. \nGalípolo emphasized this inclusivity in his remarks: \n“We’ve moved from silos to synergy, empowering citizens to own their financial narratives.” \nYet, challenges persist—cybersecurity threats and data privacy concerns demand vigilant oversight, which the BCB addresses through enhanced encryption standards and annual audits. \nLooking ahead, Galípolo outlined a roadmap. \nPhase 3 of Open Finance, rolling out in late 2025, will integrate real-time payment systems with investment portfolios, enabling seamless, low-cost remittances and robo-advisory tools. \nBy 2030, the BCB aims for universal coverage, where even unbanked rural populations can access services via mobile apps. \nThis citizen-centered pivot aligns with global trends, positioning Brazil as a leader in the Global South’s fintech evolution. \nGalípolo noted, \n“Intelligence in finance isn’t about algorithms alone; it’s about amplifying human potential.” \nComplementing this milestone, the 2025 RIS Report serves as a strategic blueprint for sustainability and equity. \nTitled “Steps Toward a More Inclusive and Sustainable Financial System,” the report synthesizes two years of data from Brazil’s financial inclusion agenda, launched in 2020. \nIt reveals encouraging progress: financial inclusion rates have climbed to 82% among adults, up from 70% in 2020, driven by Pix, Brazil’s instant payment system, which now processes 3 billion transactions monthly. \nThe report’s core outlines actionable steps across four pillars: access, education, protection, and green finance. \nFor inclusion, it recommends expanding digital literacy programs in favelas and indigenous communities, targeting a 90% inclusion rate by 2027. \nSustainability takes center stage with mandates for banks to allocate 15% of portfolios to green bonds by 2026, addressing Brazil’s vulnerability to climate risks like Amazon deforestation. \nKey findings expose gaps—women and certain minorities still face 10-15% higher rejection rates for loans—prompting recommendations for bias-auditing AI lending models. \nNotable achievements include the RIS Fund’s $500 million injection into microfinance, potentially benefiting entrepreneurs. \nChallenges, such as digital divides in remote areas, are met with hybrid solutions: solar-powered ATMs and offline verification tech. \nThe report’s forward-looking stance integrates ESG metrics into regulatory scoring, incentivizing banks to prioritize social impact. \nTogether, these updates paint a cohesive picture of Brazil’s financial ecosystem evolution. \nOpen Finance provides the technological backbone, while the RIS Report released by the central bank highlights ethical guardrails. \nGalípolo’s words resonate: in an era of inequality and environmental urgency, finance must aim to serve the ubannked and underbanked. \nAs Brazil navigates global headwinds—from inflation to geopolitical shifts—these initiatives aim for resilience and financial inclusion.",

               "site_type": "general",
               "text": "September 27, 2025 at 9:40 AM EDT\nBy Redd Brown, Bloomberg News\nLisa Reich studied hard to become a forensic accountant. She worked in the field for eight years, and enjoyed interacting with her clients. But the divorce cases she often dealt with were becoming depressing.\nOne day, she wandered into a local travel agency looking to book a trip and got chatting — they offered her a role as an independent contractor that day.\n“I’m working half the hours and making quadruple my salary,” said Reich, 42, who started her own agency in 2021 and said her annual sales have been around $3 million to $3.5 million for the past three years.\n“When I was moving fields, my mother said to me ‘You’ve got a master’s in accounting, what am I going to tell the family?’” said Reich. “She’s eating her words now.”\nReich is one of a growing number of professionals who’ve left the security of jobs in finance, law and other white-collar industries to join the rapidly swelling ranks of travel advisers — a line of work that once seemed destined to disappear as travel planning moved online.\nOver the past three years, the number of people describing themselves as travel agents or advisers on LinkedIn increased by more than 50%, making it the fifth-fastest growing profession over that time.\nFor now, the demand is there, too. Travel booked through advisers — which includes accommodation, flights and activities — is expected to hit $141.3 billion next year in the U.S., equal to 26% of the total market, the American Society of Travel Advisors estimates.\n“Curation and support are the main selling points,” that distinguish in-person advice from online services or AI booking options, said Eric Hrubant, founder of New York City-based CIRE Travel, in an interview. Hrubant, 48, said he gets about three emails each week from people asking what it’s like to be a travel agent, and whether there are entry-level jobs available at CIRE.\n“I’m thinking about developing my own coaching business,” he joked.\nHrubant said some of his ultra-high net worth clients easily spend in excess of six figures on personal travel annually, while the average couple he books for spends around $40,000 per year on two weeklong vacations.\nFor Amira Bixby, 58, the catalyst for switching careers came during the pandemic. After almost three decades on Wall Street as an equity sales trader, Bixby realized while working from home that it was the first time in years that she’d been in the house when her children woke up. When her employer called everyone back into the office five days a week, she knew it was time to make a change.\nTravel was an obvious choice. “I was a luxury travel adviser before I was a luxury travel adviser,” said Bixby, who said she would regularly help friends and clients plan trips, and organized for her daughter’s travel lacrosse team to stay at a Four Seasons hotel each season.\nShe values her newfound flexibility above everything else.\n“When you can work from anywhere your life changes drastically for the better,” she said. “My son just graduated from UVA and you can imagine all the parties. I was in UVA four out of six weekends. Before that, I was skiing in the Dolomites,” the mountain range in Italy.\nAlmost anyone can set themselves up as a travel adviser, though some U.S. states do require agents to register and apply for accreditation. Many new agents will take online courses to boost their credentials, and can join established travel networks to get access to insider deals at top hotels, airlines and tour operators.\nWhile some agents charge a fee, the majority of their earnings come through commissions from hotels or tour operators on services booked for customers. Commissions can fluctuate depending on the service, but for some of the biggest brands advisers usually get around 10% of the value of the booking.\nThe amount that vacationers spend with travel agents also varies widely by agency. A survey of ASTA advisers from 2024 found that the biggest proportion of clients spent between $100 and $400 per person, per night with their travel planners. At those rates, a weeklong trip for a couple would range from $1,400 to $5,600.\nLisa Tucker, a law professor in Philadelphia, started working with a travel agent about a year ago to plan vacations for her and her four children. In April, a getaway to Rome was disrupted by an overzealous party in the boutique hotel where they were staying, and the front desk insisted no other rooms were available. Then her travel agent intervened.\n“He made one phone call and suddenly they moved us into the presidential suite,” Tucker, 57, said.\nNot everyone who makes the switch to a career in travel planning increases their earnings — at least not at first. Julia Flood, a former litigation lawyer in Toronto, knew she’d be making less when she stepped away from her job to become a travel agent. The flexibility and freedom she gained from the switch were worth it.\n“I don’t necessarily work fewer hours,” Flood, 34, said. “I do what I want and where I want — I might be booking someone’s trip while I’m sitting in a café in the South of France.”\nBooming growth across the travel industry means that companies like Expedia Group Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc., which are integrating artificial intelligence into their online booking services, have avoided any notable financial impact from the revival in travel advisers. This year, travel is forecast to contribute $11.7 trillion to the global economy, accounting for 10.3% of total output, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. By the end of the decade, that figure is expected to climb to $16.5 trillion.\nAt the same time, new agencies are making the most of the resurgent interest in travel careers. Fora Travel Inc. was founded in 2021 to give wannabe travel advisers easy access to training and technology, as well as a network of mentors and events. In April it announced it had raised $60 million in a Series B and C fundraising, led by Josh Kushner’s Thrive Capital and Insight Partners.\nCo-founder Henley Vazquez said about 97% of the company’s agents are new to the travel industry, and 86% are women — many of them parents who appreciate the flexibility of the job. For some recent entrants, it doesn’t take long to start making decent money.\n“In the past three years, we’ve had 35 advisers who have hit $1 million in sales in their first year joining,” Vazquez said in an interview.\nFlood was introduced to Vazquez through a mutual friend in 2021. At the time, she was still working as a lawyer but feeling increasingly disillusioned with her job. She knew she wanted to do something linked to travel, and Vazquez was just getting Fora off the ground. What did she have to lose, her new friend asked.\n“I didn’t have a mortgage, I didn’t have children, I don’t have any of those things that affect your thought process when making a big financial decision,” Flood said. “So it was a great time in my life to make that transition and to make the leap and, of course, I’ve never looked back.”\nFor Bixby, coming from a business background — especially one involving close client relationships and money management in New York’s lucrative finance industry — has been a boon. The first three trips she planned were for a former coworker, a mutual fund client and a close friend. Recently, a hedge fund manager she’d worked with called her up to help him plan a vacation.\n“They know I will protect their investment, and it’s not just money, it’s time,” she said.\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

               "text": " African Development Bank Group (AfDB) approves $10 million trade finance guarantee to Exim Bank Tanzania to support Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and local corporates. Source: African Development Bank Group (AfDB) \nThe African Development Bank Group Board of Directors has approved a $10 million trade finance transaction guarantee facility for Exim Bank Tanzania Limited to unlock and de-risk trade deals. \nThe facility will provide up to 100 percent guarantees to international confirming banks against risks of non-payment. This support will release trade finance lines for Exim, expand access to essential imports, and strengthen Tanzania’s private sector. \nThe new facility is expected to support up to $60 million in trade transactions over three years. The support will help Exim reduce its dependence on scarce foreign exchange collateral required by international banks, thus freeing resources for more productive lending to local businesses active in intra-African and international trade. \nSupporting trade is a key priority of the African Development Bank, the Head of Trade Finance, Lamin Drammeh said, following the approval. “Trade finance is essential for Africa’s economic development, facilitating both domestic and international trade, boosting economic growth and promoting regional integration.” \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up over 90% of Tanzanian businesses and account for a third of GDP. However, a $1.3 billion annual trade finance gap limits progress and continues to hold them back. \n“SMEs and corporates are vital engines of industrialization, innovation, and job creation, and this facility will remove barriers to cross-border trade while opening doors for new partnerships with global and regional financial institutions,” Jaffari Matundu, Chief Executive Officer of Exim Bank Tanzania Limited said. \nKey sectors such as agriculture, health, energy, and manufacturing will benefit by supporting the imports of essential goods such as fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, and farming equipment, as well as the export of Tanzanian commodities like coffee, cashew, and cotton. \nExim Bank is Tanzania’s fourth largest bank, with operations in Uganda, Djibouti, and Comoros. The facility will be implemented through agreements with Exim and participating confirming banks. \nThis project aligns with the African Development Bank’s 2024-2033 Ten-Year Strategy, the 2021-2025 Tanzania Country Strategy Paper which prioritizes improved private sector business environment for job creation through improved private sector access to finance, and the government’s Tanzania Vision 2025, which emphasizes a strong, competitive economy. \n“This partnership with Exim Bank Tanzania demonstrates the African Development Bank Group’s commitment to reducing Tanzania’s trade finance gap, empowering local businesses to compete globally and create more jobs across the country,” Drammeh said.",
