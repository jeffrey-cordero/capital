               "title": "Australia’s economy likely already bumping up against speed limits, top central banker says",
               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " CANBERRA/SYDNEY, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Australia’s top central banker said on Wednesday the economy was likely already at its potential growth limit and, should inflation turn out to be more persistent than expected, that would have implications for interest rates. \nSpeaking before lawmakers, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock said the labour market was still a bit tight as the central bank had forecast, but inflation has surprised on the upside. \n”The board is looking very hard at these recent numbers to determine the extent to which it is temporary or the extent to which it is giving us a signal that there’s some more permanent inflation pressures in the economy,” said Bullock. \nAustralia’s consumer inflation accelerated to 3.8% in October, while the trimmed mean measure of core inflation also climbed back above the target band of 2-3%. Together with a hot third-quarter result, that led markets to price out any chance of more policy easing next year. \nBullock said the central bank can look through if the pickup in inflation is temporary. \n”If it’s not, and it’s more persistent... then that’s suggesting to us the demand pressures are persisting and that might have implications for the future path of monetary policy,” she added. \nData later on Wednesday are likely to show the economy expanded by 0.7% in the third quarter, the fastest pace in nearly three years, driven by a jump in business and government investments after three rate cuts this year. \nThat would translate into an annual growth rate of 2.2%, above the RBA’s estimate of trend growth of 2%. \n”We think that the output gap probably has closed but it is uncertain, but it does mean that we are in a position where if we are in balance, there are upside risks if the economy grows a bit quickly,” said Bullock. \nThe pick-up in growth is one reason inflation has proved hotter than hoped for in recent months, leading some economists to call for the next move in interest rates would be up, rather than down. \nThe board meets next week and is considered certain to hold rates at 3.60%, and perhaps turn more hawkish on the outlook for further easing. \n(Reporting by Stella Qiu and Wayne Cole; Editing by Leslie Adler and Lincoln Feast.) \nBy Peter Hobson and Stella Qiu",

               "text": " Beverly Hills, California, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Post Summit Press Coverage) \nFilm Finance Summit brings innovation to filmmakers: \nThe Writers Guild Theatre became ground zero for the next wave of independent film financing as the Film Finance & Future Capital Entertainment Summit drew a highly curated mix of private equity executives, family offices, producers, financiers, and tech innovators. \nFounded by Real Estate mogul Doval Bacall — Hosted by “Your Script Produced! Studios, the event zeroed in on the rapidly shifting economics of independent filmmaking, and the growing role that private equity, global capital, AI, and digital assets technology will play in Hollywood’s next cycle. \nHollywood’s next wave of capital, unlocking the $12+ Trillion in private equity and crypto wealth strategically to be injected into the independent and studio level production. \nIndependent filmmakers, global investors, production companies, and emerging technology leaders were all on hand to help redefine entertainment economics. The event functioned as a marketplace for dealmaking, strategic partnerships, and investment across film, TV, and next-gen media. \nBacked by Doval Bacall Entertainment and represented exclusively by United Talent Agency, the summit positioned itself as one of the rare industry gatherings where meaningful private capital was actually in the room. Over a full day of panels and dealmaking conversations, the program explored new investment pathways for a studio system still recalibrating from the streaming era. Key topics included: \n Tax-smart investment structures \n * Studio-level financing models accessible to independents \n * How private equity is reshaping content spending \n * Family Office investment strategies in film and media \n * Unlocking global crypto wealth and tokenization models \n * Web3 rights management and digital distribution \n * Reducing investor risk across film slates and SPV’s \nIndustry insiders pointed to recurring themes: cross-border financing, structured credit, and investor-favored section 181 and the continued rise of tax-efficient investment strategies, all indicating that alternative capital is positioned to fill the gap as traditional studio spending continues to contract. \nHigh-Profile Execs, Financiers, and Creators Look Ahead to Hollywood’s Next Cycle. \nConfirmed speakers & attendees included a mix of studio veterans, producers, financiers, attorneys, and tech leaders such as Glenn S. Gainor (Hollywood Ventures Group), Doval Bacall (Your Script Produced!

We’re creating a dealmaking environment that merges entertainment, private markets, crypto wealth, and innovation at the highest level,” said Doval Bacall, Founder \n---------------------------------------- \nYour Script Produced!

               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " Germany’s economy is suffering its ”deepest crisis” since the aftermath of World War II, an industry group warned Tuesday, calling on Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government to take urgent action to spark a revival. \nEurope’s biggest economy ”is in free fall, but the federal government is not responding decisively enough”, said Peter Leibinger, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI). \nGermany is facing a perfect storm: high energy costs burdening manufacturers, weak demand for its exports in key markets, the emergence of China as an industrial rival and the US tariff onslaught. \nIt has suffered two years of recession and is forecast to eke out only meagre growth in 2025. \nThe conservative Merz, who took power in May, has pledged to revive the eurozone’s traditional powerhouse, including through a public spending blitz on defence and infrastructure. \nBut industry leaders are increasingly voicing frustration that the efforts are moving too slowly and are insufficient to tackle a host of deep-rooted problems, from chronic labour shortages to heavy bureaucratic burdens. \n”The economy is experiencing its deepest crisis since the founding of the federal republic, yet the federal government is not responding with sufficient determination,” said Leibinger. \n”Germany now needs an economic policy turnaround with clear priorities for competitiveness and growth,” he added. \n- HEAVY REGULATION, LITTLE INNOVATION - \nBrian Fuerderer, head and founder of German high-tech surgical equipment maker Microqore Medical, agreed with the BDI’s assessment, saying the economy was being held back by overregulation and a lack of innovation. \n”In Germany, entrepreneurship as such no longer really exists,” he told AFP. \n”The car manufacturers are no longer leaders... And I think that’s where the first problem starts, that the spirit of innovation is no longer encouraged or desired.” \nIn its latest report released Tuesday, the BDI -- an umbrella association for many industry federations -- forecast that German factory output will fall two percent in 2025, which would mark its fourth consecutive year of contraction. \nHeavy industry, from car-making to producing factory equipment and steel, remains crucial to the German economy. The country is home to more than 100,000 manufacturing firms of varying sizes, employing over eight million people, according to the BDI. \nBut there has been a steady drumbeat of layoff announcements in recent times, particularly in the crisis-stricken auto sector, including carmaker Volkswagen and parts supplier Bosch. \nMerz has defended his government’s actions, saying it will take time to get the economy back on track and pointing to reforms that have been enacted, including on lowering corporate income tax and reducing industry power costs. \nThere is some light on the horizon. The economy is expected to start picking up speed next year, driven by the spending ramp-up, with the government forecasting 1.3-percent growth. \nIn a statement to AFP, Germany’s leading industrial union, IG Metall, said that while the situation for German industry was ”undoubtedly serious... the whole picture is more varied than often portrayed”. \nIn certain industries such as ”aerospace, medical and energy technologies, railway manufacture and defence, things are on the whole good”, the union said, adding that sweeping tax cuts for business were not justified. \nSome hope that the thousands of jobs being axed in the auto and other industrial sectors could be replaced by new roles in defence companies, which are hiring rapidly as European countries rearm to face the growing Russian threat. \nBut Hans Christoph Atzpodien, head of defence industry association BDSV, warned that the sector’s growth could only partially offset the losses at carmakers. \n”Of course, the quantities involved and the ways of working are different,” he told a press conference Tuesday, at an event organised by the economy and defence ministries. \n”There are opportunities, but it helps to be cautious about them.” \nbur-jsk/jhb",

               "text": " Birmingham, Michigan, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Post Summit Press Coverage) \nThe Writers Guild Theatre became ground zero for the next wave of independent film financing as the Film Finance & Future Capital Entertainment Summit drew a highly curated mix of private equity executives, family offices, producers, financiers, and tech innovators. \nFounded by Real Estate mogul Doval Bacall — Hosted by “Your Script Produced! Studios, the event zeroed in on the rapidly shifting economics of independent filmmaking, and the growing role that private equity, global capital, AI, and digital assets technology will play in Hollywood’s next cycle. \nBacall is principal and partner of Bacall Companies, Birmingham, MI based, family-owned & operated commercial real estate & hospitality development and management company that is a leader in the Midwest with footprint in multiple sectors such as retail, office, food and beverage, hospitality, financial lending, and now Hollywood. He runs the company with his brothers and business partners Dante, Dorayd, and Daivin Bacall. \nBacall is now expanding his footprint into the filmed entertainment sector with a unique investment approach and strategy. Reverse engineering the process while keeping the investment center stage by structuring tax-efficient + tax smart investment that not only enables immediate tax write off for the invested capital using a tax approved clause, in addition to the immediate tax write off, the investors receive ownership stake and back end waterfall participation into top tier exclusive Hollywood level I.P’s. \nHollywood’s next wave of capital, unlocking the $12+ Trillion in private equity and crypto wealth strategically to be injected into the independent and studio level production. \nIndependent filmmakers, global investors, production companies, and emerging technology leaders were all on hand to help redefine entertainment economics. The event functioned as a marketplace for dealmaking, strategic partnerships, and investment across film, TV, and next-gen media. \nBacked by Doval Bacall Entertainment and represented exclusively by United Talent Agency, the summit positioned itself as one of the rare industry gatherings where meaningful private capital was in the room. Over a full day of panels and dealmaking conversations, the program explored new investment pathways for a studio system still recalibrating from the streaming era. Key topics included: \n Tax-smart investment structures \n * Studio-level financing models accessible to independents \n * How private equity is reshaping content spending \n * Family Office investment strategies in film and media \n * Unlocking global crypto wealth and tokenization models \n * Web3 rights management and digital distribution \n * Reducing investor risk across film slates and SPV’s \nIndustry insiders pointed to recurring themes: cross-border financing, structured credit, and investor-favored section 181 and the continued rise of tax-efficient investment strategies, all indicating that alternative capital is positioned to fill the gap as traditional studio spending continues to contract. \nHigh-Profile Execs, Financiers, and Creators Look Ahead to Hollywood’s Next Cycle. \nConfirmed speakers & attendees included a mix of studio veterans, producers, financiers, attorneys, and tech leaders such as Glenn S. Gainor (Hollywood Ventures Group), Doval Bacall (Your Script Produced! Studios), Dante DeSario (UTA), Samara Pollak (MarcyPen Capital Partners), Amara & Dasha Wayans (Wayans Empire), Michael Spanos (LA Chargers), Jethro Rothe-Kushel (Producers Guild of America), Brian O’Shea (The Exchange), Brian Altounian (Miramontes Capital), Zack Ellison (Applied Real Intelligence), Prince Ace (CineBlock), Erik White and many more. \nConversation throughout the day centered on the new reality for independent production: tighter studio output, rising demand for private capital, and a broad push to build more innovative, more resilient financing models. \n“I walked in, not knowing what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of people who attended and the very thoughtful conversations we had not just on the panel, but the intelligent questions that were asked,” said Glenn Gainor, panelist. \nLooking Ahead: A Bigger, Broader 2026 Edition \nBacall confirmed that planning is already underway for an expanded 2026 summit, which will include: \n * Larger accredited investor roundtables \n * International crypto-wealth and tokenization segments \n * Tax smart investment strategies that attract investors \n * SPV and slate-equity financing programs \n * Global delegations \n * AI and production-tech showcases \n * A much larger and stronger presence from Wall Street and private markets \nTHE GOAL: To Anchor the summit as the ultimate bridge between Hollywood and global private-capital ecosystem, driving the industry’s next wave of growth. \n“This summit is about bringing the smartest capital in the world directly into the creative ecosystem – and building structures that finally de-risk what has historically been viewed as a volatile asset class. We’re creating a dealmaking environment that merges entertainment, private markets, crypto wealth, and innovation at the highest level,” said Doval Bacall, Founder \n---------------------------------------- \nYour Script Produced!

               "text": " The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) and Ant International are strengthening their partnership to accelerate the digital transformation of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) nationwide. \nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251202701220/en/ \n(L-R) Chen Leiming, Senior Vice President & Chief Sustainability Officer of Ant International; Ir. Wan Murdani Wan Mohamad, Vice President of Digital Adoption, MDEC; Ian Cheong, CEO of EPOS \nIn a newly established Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Ant International will empower local MSMEs through EPOS, the all-in-one SME transformation platform of Ant International’s Antom, offering a comprehensive suite of digitalisation solutions. MDEC will support the programme by engaging the MSME community, industry associations, and ecosystem partners to drive broad-based digital adoption across the country. \nThis builds on MDEC’s ongoing collaboration with Ant International to support local talent and innovation development through its global digital business centre in Kuala Lumpur under the Business Digitalisation Initiative (BDI). \nAnuar Fariz Fadzil, CEO of MDEC said, ”Digitalisation has become a fundamental requirement for MSMEs to stay competitive and resilient. Our deepened collaboration with Ant International directly supports Malaysia’s journey towards an AI Nation, ensuring that even the smallest enterprises can access modern, AI-enabled tools. By synergising global technology capabilities with Malaysia’s national priorities, we are empowering MSMEs to transform how they operate, strengthen their business foundations, and participate fully in the opportunities of the digital economy.” \nDriving Digital Inclusion for Malaysian MSMEs \nMSMEs represent the backbone of Malaysia’s economy, accounting for 97% of all business establishments. Yet many still face challenges in adopting digital tools due to limited access, cost barrier, and lack of technical knowledge. \nThis collaboration is designed to bridge those gaps. Through EPOS, Ant International will unify its ecosystem of digital solutions and cutting-edge AI technologies, into a single platform that integrates payments, digital banking solutions, and growth tools tailored for MSMEs. With EPOS, MSMEs will gain access to simple, affordable, and powerful digital solutions-including payments, multi-channel online store deployment, operations management, and AI-powered productivity tools-all accessible within minutes. \nMerchants can also unlock valuable business insights that enables them to run operations more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and expand their reach across online channels. \nRetail and F&B merchants stand to gain significantly. These sectors continue to face rising labour costs, manpower constraints, and increasing customer expectations for seamless, digitally enhanced experiences. As consumer behaviour shifts toward mobile-first engagement, digitalisation is no longer optional, but it is essential for sustained competitiveness and growth. \nIan Cheong, CEO of EPOS, said: ”Malaysian MSMEs are ambitious, resilient, and eager to grow, but they need the right tools to compete in an increasingly digital economy. MDEC has made great strides in supporting MSME digitalisation, and through EPOS, we can advance this national strategy even further. By making advanced technology accessible within minutes, so that even the smallest business can operate smarter, serve customers better, and scale with confidence, we can ensure no MSME is left behind.” \nLeveraging Malaysian Ecosystems for Support \nAs the agency leading Malaysia’s transformation towards an innovation-led digital economy, MDEC will spearhead initiatives to connect local communities, industry partners and ecosystem players, enabling them to collectively reach SMEs across diverse sectors. \nThese initiatives will include workshops and training sessions to raise awareness and facilitate access to new technologies such as AI, co-developed programs to engage SMEs and support them in adopting digital solutions, and strategic alignment of the partnership with MDEC’s broader national digitalisation strategies and ongoing initiatives. \n### \nAbout MDEC \nThe Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) was established in 1996 to spearhead the country’s digital economy. MDEC launched Malaysia Digital (MD), a national strategic initiative aimed at addressing current key challenges in the digital landscape for a robust and agile digital economy.

               "text": " United States Latest News,United States Headlines \nBlackRock executives Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein predict that tokenization will connect crypto with traditional finance and modernize outdated systems. \nBlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management, and operates the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion.Former crypto skeptic BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein say tokenization will act as a bridge between the crypto industry and traditional finance, doubling down on their support of the sector. \n“Think of it instead as a bridge being built from both sides of a river, converging in the middle. On one side stand traditional institutions. On the other are digital-first innovators: stablecoin issuers, fintech’s and public blockchains,” the pair wrote. “The two aren’t competing so much as learning to interoperate. In the future, people won’t keep stocks and bonds in one portfolio and crypto in another. Assets of all kinds could one day be bought, sold and held through a single digital wallet.”BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Its co-founder and CEO, Fink, was previously a crypto skeptic before heFink and Goldstein said at first glance, it was hard for them to see the “big idea” because tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which “often looked like speculation.” “But in recent years, traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today,” they added.Regulators should allow TradFi, tokenized markets to work together However, Fink and Goldstein also stated that tokenization must proceed safely, with appropriate regulations, which requires policymakers and regulators to update the rules to enable traditional and tokenized markets to work together.Bond exchange-traded funds followed a similar path for fixed income, connecting dealer markets with public exchanges, allowing investors to trade more efficiently, according to Fink and Goldstein. “And now with spot Bitcoin ETFs, even digital assets are on traditional exchanges. Each of these innovations builds bridges. The same principle applies to tokenization,” they said. “Regulators should aim for consistency: risk should be judged by what it is, not how it’s packaged. A bond is still a bond, even if it lives on a blockchain.”Animoca’s bet on altcoin upside, analyst eyes $100K Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest, Nov. 23 – 29",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " AI-driven investment continues to propel national and state growth, but tariffs, immigration policy and weak labor markets restrain momentum across key sectors \nLOS ANGELES, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The December 2025 UCLA Anderson Forecast for the United States and California describe a situation with two economic trends currently working in opposition. In some sectors of the economy, ongoing and optimistic investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure and rising income among high-wealth households drive the economy, while tariff-induced inflation, policy-driven uncertainty and a gradually weakening labor market indicate signs of sectoral weakness. The result is an economy expected to soften through the first quarter of 2026 before regaining strength later in the year. \nIn California, the outlook is further complicated by a bifurcated economy: AI, aerospace and other high-productivity sectors continue to expand, while construction, non-durable goods, leisure and hospitality, and government-funded services face significant headwinds. Deportations, elevated input costs, and weak job growth prolong an employment recession expected to last into early 2026, even as the state continues to outpace the nation in overall productivity. \nOn balance, the Forecast does not expect an immediate downturn or an immediate resurgence. Instead, both the nation and the state are poised to muddle through early 2026 before experiencing stronger growth in 2026 and 2027. \nThe National Economy \nThe national forecast highlights a slowing but resilient economy significantly buffeted by the sizable capital expenditures underway in AI infrastructure. The Forecast notes that projected AI-related investment in 2025 — originally estimated at $250 billion — has already surpassed $405 billion, with further increases expected in 2026. Fiscal stimulus from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is set to reinforce this investment surge. \nAt the same time, tariffs imposed throughout 2025 continue to move through supply chains, raising goods prices and placing pressure on consumers and small businesses. The ongoing policy uncertainty, including anticipated Supreme Court decisions on tariff authority, has made long-term planning difficult for firms and has contributed to a cautious hiring environment. \nEmployment growth has slowed sharply, and unemployment is expected to inch up to 4.5% by the end of 2025, though unemployment insurance claims remain low. Inflation is projected to peak at 3.5% (SAAR) in early 2026, driven largely by pass-through from earlier tariff hikes, before gradually declining but remaining above target. \nInterest rates have stabilized: Long-term rates are expected to remain near 4.0%–4.4%, as structural pressures (elevated public deficits, aging demographics and heavy borrowing linked to AI investments) prevent a return to pre-pandemic lows. \nOverall GDP growth will soften in late 2025 and early 2026, exacerbated by temporary effects from the record-setting 43-day federal government shutdown. Later in 2026, growth is expected to rebound meaningfully as both fiscal and monetary stimuli take hold. \nThe California Economy \nAt present, California’s economy continues to outpace the nation’s in high-productivity sectors such as AI, aerospace and advanced manufacturing, buoyed by the state’s disproportionate share of venture capital investment. Nearly 70% of all U.S. venture funding in early 2025 went to California, and seven of the 10 largest investment deals in the Americas this year occurred in-state. \nBut this strength masks a growing divide. Construction, nondurable goods manufacturing, retail, and leisure and hospitality remain under pressure from federal spending reductions, tariffs, elevated costs and the early effects of deportation policies. Payroll job losses through the first eight months of 2025 marked the first sustained decline since the pandemic, and California’s unemployment rate has remained above 5.0% for more than 19 consecutive months. \nThe Forecast’s analysis of historical immigration restrictions suggests that deportations tend to raise unemployment among U.S.-born and documented workers through reduced consumption and disruptions in complementary occupations. Early county-level data in California show this pattern beginning to emerge, especially in counties with higher shares of foreign-born workers employed in construction, agriculture and hospitality. \nHousing remains a significant constraint. Building permits have stayed subdued despite elevated home prices and the urgent need for new construction following the December 2024 and January 2025 wildfires. Workforce shortages tied to deportations, tariff-driven input costs and persistently high financing costs all contribute to slow progress in residential building. \nGoods movement offers a bright spot: Air cargo volume has begun to recover to pre-pandemic levels in both Northern and Southern California, reflecting steady demand in higher-income households and businesses linked to the state’s technology sector. \nCalifornia Forecast Numbers \nThe December Forecast calls for a gradual improvement beginning in late 2026: \nUnemployment Rates (Annual Averages) \n2025: 5.5% \n2026: 5.5% \n2027: 4.6% \nTotal Employment Growth \n2025: 0.6% \n2026: 0.7% \n2027: 2.0% \nNon-Farm Payroll Jobs \n2025: 0.0% \n2026: -0.1% \n2027: 1.9% \nReal Personal Income Growth \n2025: 1.8% \n2026: 1.1% \n2027: 2.6% \nResidential Permits \n2025: 101,000 \n2027: 121,000 \nUCLA Anderson’s winter 2025 economic outlook takes place on December 3 and addresses Financial Stability Amid AI and Crypto Exuberance. \nAbout UCLA Anderson Forecast \nUCLA Anderson Forecast is one of the most widely watched and often-cited economic outlooks for California and the nation and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and the strength of the state’s rebound since 1993. The Forecast was credited as the first major U.S. economic forecasting group to call the recession of 2001 and, in March 2020, it was the first to declare that the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had already begun. \nuclaforecast.com \nAbout UCLA Anderson School of Management \nUCLA Anderson School of Management is a world-renowned learning and research institution.

Workforce shortages tied to deportations, tariff-driven input costs and persistently high financing costs all contribute to slow progress in residential building. \nGoods movement offers a bright spot: Air cargo volume has begun to recover to pre-pandemic levels in both Northern and Southern California, reflecting steady demand in higher-income households and businesses linked to the state’s technology sector. \nCalifornia Forecast Numbers \nThe December Forecast calls for a gradual improvement beginning in late 2026: \nUnemployment Rates (Annual Averages) \n2025: 5.5% \n2026: 5.5% \n2027: 4.6% \nTotal Employment Growth \n2025: 0.6% \n2026: 0.7% \n2027: 2.0% \nNon-Farm Payroll Jobs \n2025: 0.0% \n2026: -0.1% \n2027: 1.9% \nReal Personal Income Growth \n2025: 1.8% \n2026: 1.1% \n2027: 2.6% \nResidential Permits \n2025: 101,000 \n2027: 121,000 \nUCLA Anderson’s winter 2025 economic outlook takes place on December 3 and addresses Financial Stability Amid AI and Crypto Exuberance. \nAbout UCLA Anderson Forecast \nUCLA Anderson Forecast is one of the most widely watched and often-cited economic outlooks for California and the nation and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and the strength of the state’s rebound since 1993.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A growing number of investors are turning their attention toward a rising DeFi altcoin that continues to gain traction across the market. With interest increasing and development progressing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most closely watched new cryptocurrency projects moving into Q4 2025. \nMutuum Finance’s Expanding Community \nMutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a decentralized lending protocol designed to support real borrowing and lending activity on-chain. The system uses two lending environments that allow users to lend assets, borrow against collateral, and earn yield tied to interest repayment. When users lend assets such as ETH or USDT, they receive mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest, creating natural APY based on protocol usage. \nInvestor participation continues to rise. Mutuum Finance has now raised $19.1 million, and the number of holders has surpassed 19,000. The project’s steady growth shows that interest is spreading quickly as more users react to the system’s structure and upcoming product launch. \nMutuum Finance opened its token sale in early 2025 at $0.01. Since then, the token has increased to $0.035, marking a 250% token appreciation during the development period. This early surge has drawn more attention to the project as traders watch for DeFi tokens with strong early momentum. \nThe project is now in Phase 6, and the current allocation is more than 98% filled. Each phase offers a fixed price and a set number of tokens. Once a phase completes, the price moves to the next tier. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which has increased participation as buyers react to the growing difference between the current price and the launch value. \nDaily community participation is reinforced by the 24-hour leaderboard, where the top contributor earns $500 in MUTM. This feature helps the project maintain steady inflow and has contributed to the rapid pace of Phase 6. \nToken Distribution and Additional Access Options \nMutuum Finance has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. Out of this supply, 1.82 billion tokens, or 45.5%, were allocated for early buyers. More than 810 million MUTM tokens have already been purchased. Analysts note that this distribution structure spreads ownership across a large number of users, helping stabilize the protocol over time. \nAccessibility has also played a major role in the project’s growth. Mutuum Finance supports card payments, allowing buyers to join without needing advanced blockchain knowledge or complicated wallet setups. This option has opened the project to users across different regions and has helped increase daily participation. \nDevelopment Progress \nMutuum Finance recently confirmed on its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch in Q4 2025. The first version will include the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidator bot, and the debt-tracking system. ETH and USDT will be supported at launch, allowing users to test key lending and borrowing features. \nThe team continues to work through Phase 2 of its development roadmap. This phase includes smart contract refinement, interface updates, lending logic improvements, data tracking tools, and additional internal testing. The focus remains on stability and performance as the protocol moves closer to public testing. \nWith development advancing and the testnet confirmed, interest in Mutuum Finance continues to rise. The combination of real utility, lending yield, and active development has placed MUTM on several lists of top crypto projects to watch leading into 2026. \nSecurity and Reliability \nSecurity remains one of Mutuum Finance’s strongest components. The project completed a CertiK audit, receiving a 90/100 Token Scan score, and Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts. The team also runs a $50,000 bug bounty to identify potential issues before the testnet goes live. \nThese security layers help build trust among users, especially in a DeFi sector where safety standards vary widely. A strong security base is often a major factor for long-term protocol adoption. \nMutuum Finance is now approaching the final moments of Phase 6. With more than 98% of tokens allocated at the current price, the remaining supply is decreasing at a fast pace. This stage often moves quicker than earlier phases because users try to secure the current price before the next increase. \nWith rising participation, audited contracts, steady development progress, expanding community metrics, mtToken yield, and stablecoin plans underway, Mutuum Finance is becoming a top name in discussions about potential best crypto to buy now under $0.05. \nAs the project moves closer to its V1 launch and the remaining allocation diminishes, further updates are expected from the team regarding platform testing and the next steps in Phase 2 development. \nFor more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below: \nWebsite: https://www.mutuum.com \nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance",

               "text": "U of A to Play Vital Role in State’s Lithium Economy\nDec. 03, 2025\nArkansas Department of Commerce\nThe second annual Arkansas Lithium Innovation Summit was held in Little Rock.\nLithium batteries power our cellphones, laptops and hybrid cars. Today, most lithium is mined in South America, but the newly discovered Smackover Formation in southwest Arkansas contains 5 to 19 million tons of lithium, enough to meet the world’s estimated 2030 demand for lithium nine times over.  \nThe future of lithium extraction and its economic impact on the state of Arkansas was at the forefront of the second annual  Arkansas Lithium Innovation Summit  held in late October. Thegathering brought together researchers, state leaders and industry representatives as they began to map out the next steps of the potential boom. \n”The first summit was about the promise, and this one was about the progress,” said Erik Pollock, director of the U of A’s Stable Isotope Laboratory and co-founder of the Arkansas Lithium Technology Accelerator. \nCommercial extraction of lithium in Arkansas is scheduled to begin next year. \n”We want to build out the conversion, the refining and the manufacturing all right here where this valuable resource sits,” said Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the keynote address to the summit. ”And with your help, we know that Arkansas will be a leader and an innovator in the global lithium market and help put this industry on the map for the United States.” \nThe two-day event in Little Rock was attended by nearly 900 people, including more than two dozen U of A professors, staff, students and alumni. \n”Arkansas is uniquely positioned in the intersection of geology, innovation and proactive governance. We have a world-class resource in this Smackover Formation, pioneering DLE technology to extract it sustainably, global corporations committed to invest and the legislative will to build the upstream and midstream supply chain right here in the state,” said Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald, whose office helped organize and plan the summit. \nPresenters at the summit included U of A faculty Christopher L. Liner and John Shaw, both from the Department of Geosciences, along with Jamie Hestekin of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Xiangbo ”Henry” Meng of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. \nThe U of A has four areas of expertise that can support the burgeoning lithium industry, Pollock said. The school’s geoscientists can help industry understand both what is below the ground and the hydrologic component necessary for surface waterworks. As a leader in supply chain management, the Sam M. Walton College of Business can provide logistics support. The U of A has deep expertise in material science and novel materials. And engineers are working on separation science involving solvents and membranes. \n”We have a way of doing lithium. We probably will have a better way of doing lithium in the near future,” Pollock said. \nThe U of A can also provide the workforce the state needs to develop and oversee lithium extraction. \n”There’s going to be a workforce that will develop down there,” Pollock said. ”It’s going to take a lot of people who can think. And 35,000 of the college students in Arkansas are right here.” \nTo learn more about how the U of A is uniquely positioned to partner with businesses and offer solutions in the emerging lithium economy, visit  lithium.uark.edu . \nTopics",

Agriculture is essential to human life. How we feed ourselves matters for nutrition, health, climate, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

The WBG has committed to double its agricultural financing to $9 billion a year by 2030. In October it launched AgriConnect, an initiative seeking to transform small-scale farming into an engine of sustainable growth, jobs, and food security. \nHowever, while some MDB investments support equitable and sustainable transformation, too many still fuel environmental destruction and inequity. The World Bank’s private sector arm, IFC, recently invested $47 million in a multi-story pig factory farm in China, for example. \nA new report from the University of Vermont Institute for Agroecology analyses MDB agricultural investments and sets out a road map for how banks can support, rather than hinder, sustainable farming. The research finds that the World Bank and other public-sector lenders can drive systemic change by supporting governments with policy reforms, rural extension services, and enabling environments. For example, a $70 million Inter-American Development Bank project in Paraíba, Brazil is promoting inclusive, low-carbon agriculture, and strengthening family farmers and traditional communities through technical assistance and climate-resilient infrastructure. \nMDBs’ private sector operations must reform their lending criteria and stop financing destructive projects. \nMDBs are better placed than other financial institutions to take long-term, lower-return investments aligned with climate and food security goals. Agroecological farming, a holistic, community-based approach to food systems that applies ecological and social food sovereignty concepts, along with long-term productivity, provides a channel for public sector arms of MDBs to support needed agricultural transformation. MDBs and other public banks therefore, should seek to become the enablers of agroecology. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) are already leading efforts in this direction. \nIn contrast to the IFAD and AFD models, the University of Vermont’s Institute for Agroecology’s report found that the majority of private-focused MDBs prioritize “bankable” projects—typically large-scale, industrial, profit-driven agribusiness. This model steers money toward factory farms that use human-edible food as feed, pollute nearby communities, raise the risks of zoonotic disease and antimicrobial resistance, and engage in animal cruelty. In 2023, a report by Stop Financing Factory Farming found that public finance institutions invested US$2.27 billion in factory farming, 68% of the total investment in animal agriculture projects that year. \nAs evidenced by multiple complaints from impacted communities, these investments undermine poverty reduction, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Paris Agreement climate goals. MDBs’ private sector operations must reform their lending criteria and stop financing destructive projects. \nRich country governments currently subsidize agriculture, mostly industrial, at a level of $842 billion per year. According to the IMF, only a quarter is dedicated to support for public goods in the sector. Shifting this support to incentivize investments in agroecology is crucial to sustain the agricultural transformation that public banks themselves have called for. \nPublic banks have the opportunity to join a growing number of organisations already advancing an ecological approach to meet the SDGs and wider social, cultural, and economic, and environmental objectives. To do so, they must shift from treating agroecology as merely a niche solution and instead invest in it as a priority means for achieving food systems transformation. \nAgroecology puts an end to costly and harmful practices, replacing animal cruelty with humane, safe, and fair standards. \nBy taking this approach, public banks can better support just transitions in food systems, something that is already beginning to take shape. Earlier this year, for example, the World Bank backed an $800 million loan to the Colombian government to advance a greener and more resilient economic transformation. \nThe private-sector arms of MDBs, such as IFC and IDB Invest, also have a role to play in aligning with the transition. Most importantly, they can support governments with policy advice and financing criteria that break from entrenched models and exclude industrial animal agriculture from eligibility for finance. \nWhile MDBs have taken steps to make agricultural production and rural incomes less vulnerable to climate change, they have yet to commit to agroecological farming as the most effective pathway. In contrast, IFAD is already demonstrating what this can look like, driving agroecological transitions through private-sector incentives in Ethiopia, Peru, and Vietnam. Similarly, AFD is applying agroecology to support family farming in Ethiopia, Haiti, Madagascar, Malawi, and Sierra Leone. \nIf MDBs are looking to advance the SDGs and solve the polycrisis (climate, biodiversity, pandemic risk, and food security), one of the most effective ways in which this can be done is for the public sector to mobilize policy support and significant capital investment into agroecology. Meanwhile, MDB private sector arms can enable this transition by providing policy advice and finance for interventions that break from entrenched models. \nAgroecology puts an end to costly and harmful practices, replacing animal cruelty with humane, safe, and fair standards. But it’s not just about farming practices. It also helps transform food systems, building resilient, reparative, low-emission economies and improves livelihoods in line with the 2030 SDGs. \nBy supporting agroecology, MDBs can stop fueling harm and start financing a just and sustainable food systems transition. If they are serious about the SDGs, food security, and climate goals, the road map is clear—MDBs’ public sector operations must enable, their private sector operations must reform, and both must support a transition away from industrial agriculture toward a more just and sustainable food system. \nAgriculture is essential to human life.

               "text": "Europe’s Energy Transition Destroyed its Economy\nby Tyler Durden\nAuthored...\nYou can have cheap, dependable electricity to encourage economic growth and prosperity, or you can have a grid supported by wind and solar energy. Europe chose the latter .\nSo far, the promise of “abundant solar and wind energy” has only succeeded at one thing: slashing carbon emissions by 30% from 2005 levels. Thankfully, food for European families is paid for by reducing greenhouse gases, right? Unfortunately, the emission reduction is the only benefit to be had by Europe’s current plan of destroying dependable coal and nuclear plants in favor of building unpredictable and unreliable wind and solar energy infrastructure. Here is the WSJ with the damning facts: \n“Germany now has the highest domestic electricity prices in the developed world, while the U.K. has the highest industrial electricity rates, according to a basket of 28 major economies analyzed by the International Energy Agency. Italy isn’t far behind. Average electricity prices for heavy industries in the European Union remain roughly twice those in the U.S. and 50% above China.”\nMaybe burning all bridges - and blowing up subsea pipelines - to cheap Russian conventional energy was not the best idea.\nIn any case, absent huge changes, Europe has permanently excluded itself from the entire data center and AI industry boom. Why are all the data centers in the western world being built mostly in the US? Just look at the chart above. A massive cost to data center operators is the extremely electrical demand of their server racks and their cooling systems. They can pay over 25 c/kWh in some European countries, or they can come over here and pay as low as 8 c/kWh. The difference is an immediate deal breaker.\nIn some cases, it’s not even the prices turning off the data centers: European infrastructure industry just can’t handle it. “Jerome Evans, the CEO of a German data-center operator, sought to expand his two data centers in Frankfurt, Germany’s internet crossroads. The local power provider told him he would have to wait a decade, until 2035, for the energy to power them.”\nThe examples showcasing the results of Europe’s energy infrastructure choices are endless:\n“‘We are hemorrhaging industry,’ said Dieter Helm, an economic professor at Oxford University who has advised U.K. governments on energy policy. British chemical company Ineos said in October it would close two plants in western Germany because of high energy costs. In recent days, Exxon-Mobil said it would close its chemical plant in Scotland and threatened to exit Europe’s chemicals industry, saying green policies made it uncompetitive.”\nMeanwhile, the unpredictability of solar and wind is hurting everything everywhere. The costs of construction and operation are obscured by carbon taxes and government subsidies, and power finds its way to the grid on cloudy or windless days anyways, so what’s the issue? Those powerless days where panels and mills are sitting idle require power to be purchased, at a premium, from nearby countries. When this occurs for weeks at a time, prices can skyrocket for everyone.\nAs highlighted earlier, the problems are also only just starting, and  the question of what to do with the impending wave of “renewable waste” will demand an answer .\nEurope pursued the grand energy transition using the “or” strategy, in contrast to the “and” strategy used by the US. Europe has decided to shutdown all of its coal, gas, and nuclear plants while trying to at the same time build as much wind and solar as possible to replace the destroyed capacity. Compare this to countries like the US that instead decided to build more of everything at the same time, and the results become alarmingly clear.\nThe US took its buildout of nuclear energy a step further with the announcement of nearly a billion dollars for deploying new advanced reactor technology. $400 million will be provided to the Tennessee Valley Authority for developing the BWRX-309 reactor, a joint venture reactor design between GE Vernova and Hitachi. Their reactor is already under construction in Canada at the Darlington site, while the permit to start construction of the second iteration is under review by the NRC.\nAnother $400 million will go to Holtec to deploy two of their SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades site in Michigan. Both designs receiving Department of Energy funding are smaller reactors with target outputs of about 300 MW electric, compared to the much larger AP1000 reactors built in Georgia that are rated to about 1,100 MW electric. This class of small-but-still-pretty-big reactors focus on minimizing land use and supporting electric grids on a small scale. There’s also a place for them powering larger-scale data centers.\nBoth reactor projects in Tennessee and Michigan look to be grid connected in the 2030s.\nLoading recommendations...",

Notre priorité absolue, essentielle à notre réussite, est le consentement et la pleine participation des communautés autochtones sur les territoires et/ou les terres ancestrales où nous exerçons nos activités. En plus de ses autres terrains, NioBay détient une participation exclusive dans le projet de niobium James Bay, situé à 45 km au sud de Moosonee, sur le territoire traditionnel de la Première Nation Moose Cree, dans les basses terres de la baie James en Ontario. NioBay détient également une participation de 72,5 % dans le projet de niobium et de tantale Crevier situé au Québec sur le territoire Nitassinan de la Première Nation Pekuakamiulnuatsh. \nÀ propos du niobium \nLe niobium est un élément d’origine naturelle. Il s’agit d’un métal ductile, malléable et hautement résistant à la corrosion. Comme il améliore les propriétés et les fonctionnalités, le niobium est utilisé dans une large gamme de matériaux et d’applications dans les secteurs de la mobilité, des structures et de l’énergie. Le niobium transforme les matériaux. Lorsqu’il est ajouté à des matériaux tels que l’acier, le verre et les pièces moulées en aluminium, le niobium les rend plus efficaces et réduit leur incidence sur l’environnement, tout en augmentant leur valeur. \nMise en garde \nCertains énoncés figurant dans le présent communiqué constituent de l’« information prospective » au sens des lois sur les valeurs mobilières canadiennes applicables, notamment les énoncés portant sur les plans de la Société. L’information prospective qui figure dans les présentes comprend notamment des énoncés portant sur des activités, des événements ou des faits nouveaux qui, selon NioBay, se produiront ou devraient se produire dans l’avenir, y compris des énoncés sur le placement, la clôture du placement, l’emploi prévu du produit tiré du placement, le dépôt du document d’offre modifié et le traitement fiscal des actions accréditives.

               "title": "Lettuce Financial Identifies Five Trends Expected to Reshape the Solo Economy in 2026",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " AI adoption, corporate exits, and Gen Z accelerate growth of solopreneurs in the U.S. \nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Lettuce Financial, the AI-powered operating system built for solopreneurs, today released five key trends driving the surge of the solo economy in 2026. Economic shifts represent a fundamental reorganization of how Americans work and build wealth. From corporate talent leaving traditional employment to AI-first business models and a new generation approaching careers from a fundamentally different lens, these predictions map out the infrastructure and dynamics reshaping the future of work. \n”We’re at a moment where structural forces are aligning in favor of solopreneurs. Whether it’s a result of corporate downsizing or talented professionals choosing to leave a corporate environment, or college graduates entering an unusually tight job market, there’s never been a better opportunity to embrace becoming a solo business,” said Ran Harpaz, founder and CEO of Lettuce Financial. ”AI now handles work that once required entire teams, purpose-built platforms streamline the back office and financial operations, and benefits like high-quality healthcare and retirement plans, which were once major barriers to going independent, are finally accessible to one-person businesses. As these shifts converge, the friction that once held people back now opens the door for millions more to build businesses of one. These five predictions define what’s possible in 2026.” \nTop trends expected to drive the solo economy this year include: \nCorporate Exits Drive Surge in Solo Businesses \nThe solo economy is now at 29.8M in the U.S., with that number expected to rise dramatically in 2026. We’re seeing a solopreneur movement that’s equally driven by ongoing corporate downsizing and workers who increasingly see the advantages of independence. It’s never been easier to start and grow a business-of-one than it is today, much of it driven by AI-powered tools and platforms that cater to businesses of one. Meanwhile, solopreneurs no longer need to stay in corporate jobs for healthcare, retirement, and other benefits—these are increasingly accessible to one-person businesses. \nThe Solopreneur Operating System \nVertical SaaS has proven that purpose-built software for specific industries outperforms horizontal tools. Applied to solopreneurs, this principle creates a ”Solo OS,” an operating system designed specifically for one-person businesses. This makes it easier for talent to transition from traditional employment to becoming a solopreneur. Managing customers, issuing invoices, pricing, benefits, retirement, sales tax, website management, email campaigns, and inventory — all of it will be automated and integrated into a single operating environment. As these friction points dissolve, more talented professionals will leave corporate jobs not because they’re pushed out, but because independence finally becomes accessible. \nGen Z Is Skipping Traditional Employment \nThe decades-long decline in corporate tenure is reaching its endpoint: skipping traditional employment altogether. As entry-level jobs and corporate career ladders are vanishing, Gen Z will skip traditional employment and enter the workforce as portfolio career builders and solopreneurs from day one. They’re instinctively adopting fractional positions or polyworking approaches, whether it’s out of necessity or because they see an opportunity. Rather than waiting for a corporate opportunity that may never come, they’re going fractional from the start, building their own path as solopreneurs. \nThe Rise of AI-Native Solo Businesses \n2026 marks the inflection point where an AI-first strategy becomes the default architecture for solo businesses. Rather than building a business and then layering AI tools on top, more solopreneurs will build their entire operation around AI automation from day one, creating a fundamental competitive advantage over those retrofitting AI into existing practices. This includes AI-first core functions, such as the back-office (like finance) or building and managing an entire marketing presence across webpages, content creation, and social media. \nThe Great Unbundling of Professional Services \nJust as we’ve seen marketing agencies dissolve and fragment into specialized solos, including copywriters, creative directors, and strategists now operating independently—accounting and finance firms will experience the same shift. Highly skilled professionals working independently will replace established professional services firms like the Big Five consulting firms, offering superior expertise at lower costs. Businesses of all sizes, from SMBs to enterprises, will gain direct access to top talent without the overhead of massive firms. \nAbout Lettuce Financial \nLettuce Financial is the fintech platform built for solopreneurs, giving businesses of one the corporate-level advantages traditionally reserved for companies with many employees. Powered by AI, the platform provides a secure operating system that streamlines business operations and financial strategies, including accounting, payroll, benefits, and tax compliance. By handling the complexities of business management, Lettuce gives solopreneurs peace of mind and the financial edge to run and grow smarter, more profitable businesses. \nLearn more at www.lettuce.co or follow the company on LinkedIn or Instagram. \nFor media inquiries only, please contact: \nElizabeth Gordon \n[email protected] \n408.840.9883 \nSOURCE Lettuce Financial",

               "text": " NEW YORK, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Economic shifts are remaking where and how Americans work, as the estimated population of independent professionals increased in every one of the United States’ top 30 markets last year, with cities like Las Vegas and Nashville offering freelancers the highest average earnings, according to a new report released by Fiverr International Ltd. (NYSE: FVRR) today. \nAnalyzing data from millions of tax returns and Non-Employer Statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, the annual Freelancer Economic Impact Report developed with market research firm Illuminas estimates the size, growth, and earnings of the independent professional workforce in top markets from 2019 through 2024. \nThe data uncovers significant shifts in where and how America’s freelancers are working, with the fastest growing markets for the number of freelancers including Orlando (32%), Miami (32%), Nashville (24%), Las Vegas (22%), San Antonio (20%), and Dallas (20%). Revenues increased the most in Miami (71%) and Orlando (62%), while New York, Los Angeles, and Miami had the highest number of freelancers overall. \nDefying their reputations as solely entertainment and tourism hubs where artists, musicians, and performers chase their dreams, freelancers in Las Vegas ($62,083), Nashville ($61,569), and Los Angeles ($61,303) had the highest average incomes, showing that freelancing can help make those dreams financially sustainable. Despite ranking 22nd in total number of freelancers, Nashville outearned much larger markets for creative services revenue, ranking third behind only Los Angeles and New York City. \nReversing declines seen in some tech hubs, such as San Francisco and San Jose, during the pandemic, all 30 markets experienced growth in independent workers in the past year. The surge aligns with other data showing that U.S. businesses have increased freelance hiring by 260% in recent years. The U.S. now has an estimated 6.9 million independent professionals and nearly 4 million freelancers concentrated in the top 30 cities — an annual increase of 4.3%. The report also shows independent professionals in the U.S. are estimated to generate $319 billion in revenue, representing 1.1% of U.S. GDP, and $208 billion in just the top 30 markets. \n“Freelancing has become one of the most powerful forces reshaping the American workforce,” said Fiverr’s Head of Community, Michelle Baltrusitis. “People are no longer tied to a single company or city; they’re building flexible, fulfilling careers on their own terms. The future of work is already here, and it’s independent.” \nAccording to Beau Vallis, a Miami-based Fiverr freelancer: “Miami gives you sunshine — freelancing gives you freedom. I went all-in on both, and it changed everything. Tens of thousands of projects later, I’ve helped transform lives worldwide… including my own. I cannot be more thankful for the life and flexibility freelancing has provided.” \nThe report categorized cities into nine groups based on their freelance economies, growth rates, and demographics. Three patterns emerged: \n Sunbelt Professional Havens (Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Phoenix) experienced the fastest growth in the number of independent professionals and revenues over the past 5 years. \n * Lone Star Boomtowns (Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio) were the second-fastest-growing market group, based on the number of independent professionals, and the third fastest in revenue. These markets are also young, with higher percentages of their total population falling under the age of 35 compared to other markets, and more diverse. \n * Rising Tech Hubs (Austin, Denver, Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, Richmond, and Salt Lake City) were the third-fastest-growing in independent workers and second-fastest in revenue, and may be the next tech hub for freelancers as the tech economy in general shifts from the large tech centers to smaller cities. \n  \nAdditional findings from the report include: \n * Location-driven earnings gap: There was a 60% difference between the highest average earnings market ($62,083 in Las Vegas) and the lowest ($38,871 in Minneapolis), with independent professionals in the top 30 markets earning $52,002 on average, around $5,748 more than the overall U.S. average. \n * 3.5 million professional service freelancers (including those in legal, accounting, marketing, bookkeeping, management consulting, and business support) comprise more than half of independent workers (51%) and nearly half of the revenues (48%). \n * 1.8 million technical service freelancers (architecture, computers, data processing, design, engineering, computer/IT, and scientific services) make up 26% of workers and 36% of revenues. \n * 1.5 million creative services freelancers (artists, video producers, writers, performers, and sound professionals) represent 22% of independent workers nationally and 16% of revenues. \nSee the full report here, along with an interactive map where you can check out the data by region. \nMethodology \nThe research was conducted by Illuminas in partnership with Fiverr, analyzing annual U.S. Census Bureau Nonemployer Statistics (NES) datasets from 2013–2023 to identify trends in the skilled independent workforce — defined as creative, technical, and professional independent workers across 26 NAICS industry codes. This data series, compiled by the Census Bureau, is based on tax filings from approximately 30 million businesses across 450 NAICS industries that have no paid employees or payroll, are subject to federal income taxes, and have receipts of $1,000 or more. The report includes 2024 estimates for the total number and revenues of skilled independent workers, calculated by applying a balancing weight—based on the most recent market-level and U.S. GDP data—to 2021–2023 growth rates and projecting them from the latest available 2023 figures. \nAbout Fiverr \nFiverr’s mission is to transform the way the world creates and works together.

               "title": "RELM LAUNCHES INSURANCE PRODUCTS TO BRING RESILIENCE TO INNOVATORS IN $1.8 TRILLION SPACE ECONOMY",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Hamilton, Bermuda , Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Relm Insurance, the leading specialty insurer for emerging and innovative industries, today announced a new suite of insurance products designed for the rapidly expanding space economy. These products equip brokers and clients with coverage that strengthens business resilience from early-stage development through to established technologies. \nBuilding on its existing launch and in-orbit underwriting capabilities for next generation rockets and spacecraft, including cover for constellations, Relm is introducing two new  specialized offerings: \n OMEGA SPACE: a combined financial, professional, and cyber tech policy for enterprises using space-based signals, data, and analytics to provide services to their clients. \n * NOVASPACE: a bespoke errors and omissions (E&O) policy for firms in the space supply chain. \nRelm has also opened its SIGMA product suite to the space economy. SIGMA provides up to nine lines of insurance, from management liabilities to fiduciary and crime, for complex businesses that want the convenience of buying all critical insurance covers in one place. \nINDUSTRY DEMAND FOR RESILIENT SOLUTIONS \nThe space industry is currently valued at over $630 billion, and forecasts suggest it could reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. Within that, McKinsey projects that the backbone of the space economy — satellites, launch, and in-orbit services like ground stations — will expand at twice the rate of global GDP, growing from roughly $330 billion in 2023 to $755 billion by 2035. Downstream revenues, led by communications, are expected to match that scale. For brokers and clients, this rapid development translates into new classes of risk, evolving capacity needs, and greater opportunities to secure specialized coverage. \n“We’re seeing a wave of new entrants in the space sector as companies push the boundaries of data, connectivity, and infrastructure,” said Joseph Ziolkowski, CEO and Founder of Relm Insurance. “Launch vehicles and launch site operations alone are projected to triple revenue from $13 billion to $32 billion by 2035. Ground station capacity is projected to expand fivefold while satellite deployments accelerate at an unprecedented pace. Our suite of space insurance products give companies and brokers the resilience they need with risk solutions that evolve as fast as the technologies they support.” \nEach of Relm’s three products is structured to let clients add or adjust layers over time. That flexibility helps brokers deliver tailored solutions as clients transition from concept to launch and into commercial operations. \nHOW RELM’S PRODUCTS ADDRESS GAPS IN THE SPACE ECONOMY \nRelm’s product suite is designed to meet and mitigate structural challenges in the space economy: \n * Supply chain resilience within the spacecraft manufacturing industry, covering failures of technology that may have knock-on effects including delay and missed launch. \n * Under-insurance among smaller satellite operators. \n * Data integrity risk for businesses that rely on space assets to provide critical services to their terrestrial customers. \n * Cyber exposure across ground and network infrastructure. \nRelm’s model blends data-informed assessment with broker-led distribution for an approach that ensures access to reliable capacity and coverage clarity. \n“Legacy insurance models assume siloed risk. In space, that doesn’t work. Exposures overlap across hardware, software, launch, and data,” said Andrew Bonwick, Relm’s VP of Product Development. “With OMEGASPACE, NOVASPACE, and SIGMA we’ve built products that mirror how companies actually operate. This makes it easier for brokers to structure protection that fits their clients’ realities.” \nHe added, “Our aim is to make insurance an enabler of progress. If a company adds new payload capacity or a downstream data service, its coverage can evolve without friction.” \n- ENDS - \nABOUT RELM INSURANCE \nThe Relm Insurance group of companies comprises Relm Insurance Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled specialty insurance carrier supporting emerging industries and next-generation technologies, and its affiliates. Relm Insurance was launched in 2019 to address the scarcity of insurance capacity available to high-growth markets, and plays an active role in bolstering the resilience of innovative industries. \nRelm’s unrivaled industry expertise and solutions-driven track record make it a highly sought-after risk partner for businesses and institutions operating at the forefront of various industries including web3, digital assets, AI, biotech, and the space economy.

HSI 1, après avoir reçu les actions issues de la conversion ou de l’exercice des OCEANE-BSA, n’a pas vocation à rester actionnaire de la Société. \nLes actions Haffner Energy, résultant de la conversion ou de l’exercice des titres susvisés, pourraient être cédées dans le marché par HSI 1 à brefs délais après la conversion ou l’exercice, selon le cas, des OCEANE-BSA, ce qui pourrait créer une pression baissière élevée sur le cours de l’action Haffner Energy. \nLes actionnaires de la Société pourraient ainsi subir une perte de valeur de leur capital investi en raison d’une diminution significative de la valeur de l’action de la Société, ainsi qu’une dilution importante en raison du nombre élevé de titres émis au profit de la société HSI 1. \nLes investisseurs sont invités à être vigilants avant de prendre toute décision d’investissement dans les actions Haffner Energy. Les investisseurs sont notamment invités à prendre connaissance des risques afférents à ce type d’opérations, mentionnés dans le communiqué ci-dessous. \nIl est rappelé qu’en application de l’article 14 du règlement (UE) 2017/1129 du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 14 juin 2017, l’émission des OCEANE-BSA ainsi que des actions résultant de la conversion ou de l’exercice, selon le cas, des OCEANE-BSA, ne donnera pas lieu à la publication d’un Prospectus soumis à l’approbation de l’Autorité des marchés financiers. \nCe communiqué ne constitue donc pas un prospectus en vertu du règlement (UE) 2017/1129 du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 14 juin 2017, tel que modifié, ou une offre au public. \nHaffner Energy (la « Société ») annonce le tirage d’une Deuxième Tranche de 60 Obligations Convertibles en Actions Nouvelles et/ou Existantes de la Société, pour un montant de 300 000 euros, sans Bons de Souscription d’Actions attachés (BSA). \nCe tirage intervient dans le cadre de l’emprunt obligataire d’un montant nominal maximum de 4,8 millions d’euros sur 60 mois au profit de HSI 1, société du groupe Alpha Blue Ocean, mis en place en novembre 2025 afin de : \n * Sécuriser de façon transitoire la continuité d’exploitation de la Société et renforcer sa trésorerie afin d’accompagner, notamment, une phase d’évolution technologique majeure ; \n * Soutenir les opérations commerciales et la stratégie de Haffner Energy tandis que l’entreprise poursuit ses efforts de développement en Europe, en Asie, au Moyen-Orient et en Amérique du Nord. \nCadre juridique de l’émission \nCette émission ne donnera pas lieu à l’établissement d’un prospectus soumis à l’approbation de l’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). Les principales caractéristiques des Bons d’Emission, des OCEANE, des BSA ainsi que la destination des fonds provenant des souscriptions sont détaillés dans le communiqué de presse de lancement de l’opération du 4 novembre 2025. \nUn tableau de suivi des Bons d’Emissions, des OCEANE et des BSA est disponible sur le site internet de la Société accessible à www.haffner-energy.com, section « Investisseurs », rubrique « Documentation financière / Autres informations réglementées ». \nLa Société rappelle que les Bons d’Emission d’OCEANE-BSA ont été émis sur la base de la délégation de compétence conférée par l’Assemblée Générale Extraordinaire du 29 septembre 2025, aux termes de sa onzième résolution, au Conseil d’administration, à l’effet d’émettre des titres financiers et/ou des valeurs mobilières donnant accès immédiatement ou à terme, à une quotité du capital, avec suppression du droit préférentiel de souscription (DPS) des actionnaires au profit de catégories de personnes dont les fonds d’investissement. \nLa Société rappelle également qu’au cours de sa réunion du 24 octobre 2025, le Conseil d’administration de la Société, faisant usage de la délégation de compétence et des autorisations conférées aux termes de la 11ème résolution de l’AGE du 29 septembre 20251, a approuvé le principe d’une émission d’obligations convertibles en actions représentant un emprunt obligataire d’un montant nominal maximum de 4,8 millions d’euros, assorties le cas échéant de BSA, et a délégué au Directeur Général tous pouvoirs à effet de décider et de réaliser l’émission gratuite de 960 Bons d’Emission d’OCEANE-BSA au profit de l’Investisseur ainsi que leur exercice. \nPrincipaux risques liés à l’émission des OCEANE et des BSA attachés, le cas échéant \n-        Risque de dilution \nDans la mesure où les actionnaires de la Société ne participeront pas à l’émission des actions nouvelles résultant de la conversion d’OCEANE et de l’exercice des BSA, leur quote-part de capital et de droits de vote de la Société sera diminuée, et de manière potentiellement significative, en cas de conversion de tout ou partie des OCEANE et d’exercice de tout ou partie des BSA. \nLes impacts de dilution sont décrits ci-dessus. \n-        Risque en cas de non-réalisation de toutes les Tranches \nLe montant total de l’émission d’OCEANE n’est pas garanti et dépendra notamment des conditions de marché. La Société pourrait donc être amenée à rechercher des financements complémentaires dans l’hypothèse où elle ne serait pas en mesure d’émettre les Tranches prévues. \n-        Risque de volatilité et de liquidité des actions de la Société \nL’émission des actions nouvelles provenant de la conversion des OCEANE ou de l’exercice des BSA et leur cession sur le marché par l’Investisseur pourraient avoir une incidence négative sur le cours de l’action la Société et les volumes de transactions, pouvant potentiellement entrainer une certaine volatilité du cours de l’action Haffner Energy. \n-        Risque relatif à l’évolution du cours de bourse \nL’Investisseur n’ayant pas vocation à rester durablement actionnaire de la Société, les cessions d’actions nouvelles émises sur conversion des OCEANE ou exercice des BSA pourraient avoir un impact significativement défavorable sur le cours de l’action de la Société. \n-        Risque de diminution de la valeur nominale de l’action \nL’émission importante d’actions à la suite de la conversion des OCEANE et de l’exercice des BSA est susceptible d’avoir un impact baissier sur le cours de bourse de la Société. Dans ce contexte, la Société pourrait devoir procéder à des réductions de capital par voie de réduction de la valeur nominale des actions de la Société. \nLes conditions de réalisation du financement, initialement limitées à la valeur nominale de l’action à la date du communiqué du 4 novembre 2025 soit 0,10 euro, pourront donc être remises en cause.2 \n-       Risque lié à la mise en œuvre de clause de pénalités \nComme indiqué dans le communiqué de presse du 4 novembre 2025, les OCEANE devront être remboursées, à la demande de l’Investisseur, en actions nouvelles ou en espèces, à 130% de leur valeur nominale en cas de survenance d’un cas de défaut. Le cas échéant, la Société sera également redevable d’une indemnité forfaitaire équivalente à 15% de la valeur nominale des OCEANE émises non converties. \n-       Risque lié à la mise en œuvre de la Commission Complémentaire \nDans l’hypothèse où le Prix de Conversion Théorique des OCEANE serait inférieur au Prix de Conversion d’une action de la Société, la Société s’est engagée à régler à l’Investisseur une Commission Complémentaire dont les modalités de calcul sont décrites ci-dessus. Le règlement, le cas échéant, de cette Commission Complémentaire pourra donner lieu au tirage, par l’Investisseur, d’une nouvelle Tranche d’OCEANE et/ou à l’émission d’actions qui viendront augmenter la dilution des actionnaires de la Société, sauf à ce que la Société opte pour la déduction du montant de cette Commission Complémentaire sur le prix de souscription d’une nouvelle Tranche. \nIncidence de l’opération \nL’émission supplémentaire de 60 OCEANE pourrait donner lieu à la création de 1 363 636 actions nouvelles et/ou existantes de la Société sur la base d’un prix de conversion théorique par action égal à 95% du plus bas cours quotidien moyen pondéré par les volumes de l’action ordinaire (« VWAP ») sur les 15 jours de bourse consécutifs précédant immédiatement la date d’émission. \n·Incidence théorique de l’émission des actions nouvelles sur la quote-part des capitaux propres  \nA titre indicatif, l’incidence de l’émission des actions nouvelles sur la quote-part des capitaux propres par action, sur la base des capitaux propres au 30 septembre 2025, et du nombre d’actions composant le capital social de la Société serait la suivante : \nQuote-part des capitaux propres \nau 31 octobre 2025 (en euros par action)3    \n  \n  \n Base non diluéeBase diluée (après exercice de tous les instruments dilutifs \nexistants à ce jour) (*)3   Tranche 1 & Tranche 2Total TranchesTranche 1 & \nTranche 2Total Tranches Avant émission des actions résultant de la conversion des OCEANE et de l’exercice des BSA0,2920,2920,3690,369 Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 (total Tranches) résultant de la conversion des OCEANE0,2880,2730,3630,333 Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 (total Tranches) résultant de l’exercice des seuls BSA0,2880,2740,3550,329 Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 et des 1 090 909 actions résultant de la conversion des OCEANE émises à titre de paiement de la commission d’engagement0,2830,2690,3580,329 Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 actions (total Tranches) résultant de la conversion des OCEANE (incluant les OCEANE émises à titre de paiement de la commission d’engagement) et de l’exercice des BSA0,2840,2710,3510,325  \n(*) en supposant l’exercice intégral des BSA Avril 2025, et des autres instruments dilutifs émis et attribués par la Société, exerçables ou non, donnant respectivement droit à la souscription de 5 829 581 actions nouvelles et avant ajustements éventuels.  \n·Incidence théorique de l’émission des actions nouvelles sur la situation d’un actionnaire détenant actuellement 1 % du capital social de la Société sur la base du   nombre d’actions composant le capital de la Société \nÀ titre indicatif, l’incidence de l’émission des actions nouvelles sur la situation d’un actionnaire détenant 1% du capital de la Société sur la base du nombre d’actions composant le capital de la Société au 30 septembre 2025, soit 62 182 201 actions, serait la suivante : \nParticipation de l’actionnaire (en % du capital social)4    \n  \n  \n Base non diluéeBase diluée (après exercice de tous les instruments dilutifs \nexistants à ce jour) (*)   Tranche 1 & Tranche 2Total TranchesTranche 1 & \nTranche 2Total Tranches Avant émission des actions résultant de la conversion des OCEANE et de l’exercice des BSA1,00%1,00%0,91%0,91% Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 (total Tranches) résultant de la conversion des OCEANE0,96%0,74%0,88%0,69% Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 (total Tranches) résultant de l’exercice des seuls BSA0,85%0,67%0,79%0,63% Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 et des 1 090 909 actions résultant de la conversion des OCEANE émises à titre de paiement de la commission d’engagement0,94%0,73%0,86%0,68% Après émission des Tranches 1 & 2 ou de 21 818 181 actions (total Tranches) résultant de la conversion des OCEANE (incluant les OCEANE émises à titre de paiement de la commission d’engagement) et de l’exercice des BSA0,84%0,67%0,78%0,63%  \nLe présent communiqué contient des informations et déclarations prospectives relatives à Haffner Energy et à ses activités.

               "text": " AUSTIN, Texas and TOKYO, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- According to DataM Intelligence, the Circular Battery Economy Market Size reached USD 23.29 billion in 2024 and is forecasted to grow exponentially to USD 77.84 billion by 2032, representing a powerful CAGR of 16.28% during 2025–2032. \nThis acceleration reflects the world’s transition toward sustainable energy systems, driven by soaring electric vehicle (EV) adoption, escalating demand for lithium-ion batteries, and the urgent need to secure critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite. \nThe circular battery economy, built around recycling, resource recovery, reuse, repurposing, and closed-loop manufacturing, is now viewed as a strategic necessity, not merely an environmental initiative. With global EV sales expected to surpass 45 million units by 2032, the industry faces enormous demand for high-purity battery-grade materials. Circular pathways are becoming the only viable solution to bridge supply gaps, reduce carbon footprints, and stabilize the global battery supply chain. \nBuy This Report with Year-End Offer (Buy 1 report: Get 30% OFF | Buy 2 reports: Get 50% OFF each! Limited time offer): https://www.datamintelligence.com/buy-now-page?report=circular-battery-economy-market \nA Strategic Industry Shift: Circularity Becomes a Competitive Advantage \n1. Global Pressure to Recover Critical Minerals \nMore than 70% of the world’s cobalt and 60% of lithium are concentrated in just a few countries, creating geopolitical vulnerability. Recycling helps reduce raw material dependence by recovering up to 95% of key elements from spent batteries. \n2. Massive Growth in EV Battery Retirements \nBy 2030, 1.4 million tons of EV battery waste will enter the recycling stream, increasing to more than 8 million tons by 2040. These volumes are creating unprecedented opportunities for secondary material markets. \n3. Corporate Sustainability Mandates \nAutomakers such as Tesla, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and BYD are mandating minimum recycled content in future battery chemistries. This shift is accelerating investments in recycling plants and closed-loop partnerships with battery manufacturers. \nMarket Segmentation \nBy Battery Type (Lithium-ion, NiMH, Lead-acid, Solid-state, Others) \nLithium-ion (Li-ion) Batteries \nLi-ion batteries dominated the market in 2024, contributing 64% (USD 14.9 billion) of total revenue. \nLi-ion batteries cover EVs, smartphones, laptops, renewable storage, and industrial equipment. With Li-ion batteries expected to make up >90% of EV battery chemistry by 2030, this segment will remain the anchor for circular technologies. \nNickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries \nNiMH batteries contributed 14% (USD 3.26 billion). \nNiMH remains relevant for hybrid vehicle fleets, energy storage systems, and power tools. Demand is steady but expected to decline as automakers transition to Li-ion dominance. \nLead-acid Batteries \nLead-acid accounted for 12% (USD 2.79 billion). \nDespite its maturity, the segment remains important due to global automotive starter batteries and industrial backup systems. Lead-acid recycling efficiency already exceeds 95%, making it a strong circularity benchmark. \nSolid-State Batteries \nSolid-state batteries represented 6% (USD 1.40 billion). \nGrowth is rapid as R&D accelerates for next-generation EV batteries with higher energy density, safety, and lower degradation. \nBy Source (Electric Vehicles, Consumer Electronics, Energy Storage Systems, Others) \nElectric Vehicles (EVs) \nEVs dominated the circular battery economy, accounting for 53% (USD 12.3 billion) of the 2024 market. \nThe rapid expansion of global EV fleets and 8–12 year battery life cycles will generate immense recycling volumes by 2030. Spent EV packs produce the largest quantities of black mass and battery-grade material for recovery. \nConsumer Electronics \nConsumer electronics contributed 27% (USD 6.28 billion), driven by smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables, and household devices. Although smaller in size, the volume of devices reaching end of life makes this a critical feedstock source. \nEnergy Storage Systems (ESS) \nESS generated 14% (USD 3.26 billion) of the market. \nGrowth in solar + battery installations and grid-scale storage is creating a rising stream of LFP, NMC, and advanced chemistries entering recycling. \nBy Technology (Collection & Sorting, Mechanical Separation, Chemical Leaching, Direct Recycling, Others) \nCollection & Sorting \nThis segment accounted for 28% (USD 6.52 billion). \nEffective collection infrastructure is foundational for circular systems, with major markets implementing extended producer responsibility (EPR) frameworks. \nMechanical Separation \nMechanical processes, including crushing, shredding, and separation, represented 32% (USD 7.45 billion)-making it the largest technology segment. \nThis stage enables production of black mass and metal concentrates. \nChemical Leaching (Hydrometallurgy & Pyrometallurgy) \nChemical leaching contributed 26% (USD 6.06 billion). \nHydrometallurgical processes are becoming the preferred route because they recover up to 95–98% of critical minerals. \nDirect Recycling \nDirect recycling accounted for 10% (USD 2.33 billion) and is rapidly emerging as a sustainable method that restores active materials (cathodes and anodes) without complete breakdown. \nDownload PDF Brochure: https://www.datamintelligence.com/download-sample/circular-battery-economy-market \nBrowse the in-depth TOC on ”Circular Battery Economy Market” \n69 – Tables \n64 – Figures \n189 – Pages \nRegional Analysis \nUnited States \nThe U.S. contributed 38% (USD 8.8 billion) in 2024. The domestic operational lithium-ion battery production capacity exceeded 200 GWh in 2024, driven by the establishment of the ”Battery Belt,” which directly creates a localized, high-volume feedstock future for recyclers. \nU.S. Market Insights \nThe U.S. is expected to surpass USD 30 billion by 2032. \nJapan \nJapan represented 8% (USD 1.86 billion) of the global market. \nJapan Market Highlights \nJapan is projected to exceed USD 6.7 billion by 2032. \nCompetitive Landscape: \nThe major global players in the market include Li-Cycle Holdings Corp., Redwood Materials Inc., Umicore SA, Glencore plc, Ascend Elements, Retriev Technologies Inc., American Battery Technology Company (ABTC), TES, Battery Resourcers, Ecobat Technologies Ltd. and others. \nFinancial Performance of Key Players (2024): \nNote: Umicore revenue conversion based on 2024 year-end exchange rate. \nBuy This Report with Year-End Offer (Buy 1 report: Get 30% OFF | Buy 2 reports: Get 50% OFF each!

Economists on Wednesday expressed significant concerns after new data from global payroll processing firm ADP estimated that the US economy lost 32,000 jobs last month. \nAs reported by CNBC, small businesses bore the brunt of the job losses, as firms with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, more than offsetting the 90,000 in job gains reported by firms with 50 or more employees. \nThe loss of 32,000 jobs in November marked a major miss for economists’ consensus estimate of 40,000 jobs added on the month, and CNBC noted that the total number of jobs lost according to ADP data ”was the biggest drop since March 2023.” \nHeather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted in a post on X that the job losses recorded by ADP were widespread across the US economy. \n”Yikes,” she wrote in reaction to the report. ”Most industries were doing layoffs. The only ones still are hiring are hospitality and healthcare.” \nLong also said the disparity between small and large businesses in terms of job growth was more evidence that the US is experiencing a ”K-shaped” economy in which those at the top of the economic ladder thrive, even as everyone else struggles. \n”Larger companies are still hiring,” she explained. ”Smaller firms (under 50 workers) are doing the layoffs. It’s been a very tough year for small biz due to tariffs and more selective spending from lower and middle-class consumers.” \nKevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, observed that ADP hasn’t reported such a big drop in small-business employment since October 2020, when the US economy was suffering through the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nAlex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, cautioned against reading too much into ADP data, although he added that ”in the absence of up to date government payrolls, all other signs point to a further deteriorating labor market.” \nCharlie Bilello, chief market strategist at financial planner Creative Planning, argued that the ADP jobs numbers were part of a negative three-month trend in which the US economy lost an estimated 4,000 jobs per month, which he said was ”the first three-month decline since the 2020 recession.” \nBilello added that ”a year ago, we were adding over 200,000 jobs per month.” \nDiane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm KPMG, argued that the ADP report showed job losses in the US economy were ”broad based” and ”were accompanied by a cooling of wage gains” for workers who still have jobs or are switching from one job to another. \n”Those with a job are clinging on, while those without are left wanting,” she explained. \nDean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argued that the ADP report blows up President Donald Trump’s spin about the health of the US economy. \n”The booming job market exists only in Donald Trump’s demented head,” he wrote. \nEconomists on Wednesday expressed significant concerns after new data from global payroll processing firm ADP estimated that the US economy lost 32,000 jobs last month. \nAs reported by CNBC, small businesses bore the brunt of the job losses, as firms with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, more than offsetting the 90,000 in job gains reported by firms with 50 or more employees. \nThe loss of 32,000 jobs in November marked a major miss for economists’ consensus estimate of 40,000 jobs added on the month, and CNBC noted that the total number of jobs lost according to ADP data ”was the biggest drop since March 2023.” \nHeather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted in a post on X that the job losses recorded by ADP were widespread across the US economy. \n”Yikes,” she wrote in reaction to the report. ”Most industries were doing layoffs.

It’s been a very tough year for small biz due to tariffs and more selective spending from lower and middle-class consumers.” \nKevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, observed that ADP hasn’t reported such a big drop in small-business employment since October 2020, when the US economy was suffering through the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nAlex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, cautioned against reading too much into ADP data, although he added that ”in the absence of up to date government payrolls, all other signs point to a further deteriorating labor market.” \nCharlie Bilello, chief market strategist at financial planner Creative Planning, argued that the ADP jobs numbers were part of a negative three-month trend in which the US economy lost an estimated 4,000 jobs per month, which he said was ”the first three-month decline since the 2020 recession.” \nBilello added that ”a year ago, we were adding over 200,000 jobs per month.” \nDiane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm KPMG, argued that the ADP report showed job losses in the US economy were ”broad based” and ”were accompanied by a cooling of wage gains” for workers who still have jobs or are switching from one job to another. \n”Those with a job are clinging on, while those without are left wanting,” she explained. \nDean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argued that the ADP report blows up President Donald Trump’s spin about the health of the US economy. \n”The booming job market exists only in Donald Trump’s demented head,” he wrote.",

               "text": " HONG KONG, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- AEON, the foundational payment & settlement layer for the new AI economy, today released new transaction data that emphasizes the growing demand for AI payments and on-chain settlement. \nAs of November, AEON has processed over 994,000 transactions and more than $29 million in volume, serving 1.75 million total users, with 87,000 new users added in the past month alone. These transactions include live AI-to-merchant payments via QR scan across real-world retail environments, demonstrating early adoption of AI economy at scale. \nAEON also confirmed that x402 data integration is now live on BNB Chain, with 36,900+ transactions and $805,000 in volume already verifiable directly on-chain via BNB x402scan. The integration provides on-chain receipts for x402 activity and lays the foundation for an open, transparent standard for AI payment transaction flows across multiple networks. \nThese milestones further validate AEON’s core vision: as AI evolves into an active participant in economic systems, the world will require a settlement layer built specifically for AI-native coordination and decision-making. Traditional payment infrastructure designed for human-initiated transactions cannot support autonomous execution, continuous micro-payments, or multi-agent value routing. A new financial architecture is required, built around identity, authorization, and settlement for AI that also settles in real time. \nAEON is building exactly that—the foundational payment and settlement layer for the new AI economy. With support for emerging standards such as x402 and ERC-8004, AEON enables verifiable identity and transactional authority for AI agents, unlocking economic agency beyond human intervention. As the call-based economy takes shape and AI gains the capacity to act economically, AEON stands positioned at the forefront of this transformation, providing the financial backbone for a world where intelligence, intent, and value flow seamlessly across networks, merchants, and AI interactions. \nAEON is not just adapting payments for AI, it is defining the financial standard that the AI economy will run on. \nAbout AEON \nAEON is the foundational payment and settlement layer built for the new AI economy. By pioneering support for emerging AI payment standards like x402 and ERC-8004, AEON is actively reshaping the internet’s production relations. Its AI payment and Web3 Mobile Payment solutions AEON Pay have processed 994k+ transactions with $29M+ in volume per month across 50M real-world merchants in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \nWith the massive shift from the attention economy to the call-based economy, AEON provides the financial backbone required to power the next-gen agentic commerce at scale, and accelerate real-world adoption of crypto and AI. \nWebsite | X | Telegram | Medium | AEON Pay \nSOURCE AEON",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Kraken has agreed to acquire Backed Finance, the tokenized asset issuer behind its xStocks product. The deal brings the issuer inside the exchange as tokenized equities gain traction.\nAd\nAd\nKraken Deepens xStocks Push With Backed Deal\nAccording to blog post , Kraken did not disclose financial terms. The move comes as Kraken prepares for a planned 2026 IPO.\nBacked issues on chain representations of about 71 assets across public equities and ETFs. Each token is backed one-for-one by the underlying security. The firm is the second-largest provider of tokenized public stocks, with about 23% market share, based on RWA.xyz data.\nThe platform said xStocks has produced more than $5 billion in cumulative trading volume on its platform. Backed has powered xStocks since the offering launched. The acquisition turns that supplier relationship into ownership.\nThe platform has expanded distribution for xStocks over the past year. It rolled the service out in the United States earlier this year. It then added access in Europe and extended support to Tron, BNB, and Solana.\nBacked’s technology is also used beyond Kraken. Bybit relied on Backed to add tokenized equities in Nvidia, Strategy, and other firms to Mantle’s on-chain ecosystem. That reach has made Backed a common backend for tokenized stock products.\nThe deal lands as tokenization shifts from pilot programs to wider use. BlackRock executives Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein recently said tokenization could reshape financial markets. They compared its potential impact to the early internet’s effect on information.\nStandard Chartered has projected tokenized real-world assets could reach $2 trillion by 2028. The bank said most activity may concentrate on Ethereum. Demand for tokenized yield products and collateral that can be used on-chain has also pushed growth through 2025, according to analysts at Oracle protocol RedStone.\nAd\nAd\nPlatform Links Tokenization Control to IPO Run-Up\nKraken’s purchase gives it closer control over issuance and maintenance for tokenized equities. It also creates a clearer path to link those assets with spot markets and collateral frameworks on the exchange. Backed, founded in 2021, will continue supporting its existing tokens during the transition.\nKraken has been building around tokenization as it scales toward public markets. The company closed a funding round this year that valued it at about $20 billion. It has also confidential draft S-1 for U.S. IPO with SEC , with a target of 2026.\nThe exchange has paired product expansion with acquisitions. It bought the Small Exchange to develop U.S. derivatives trading. It also announced a $1.5 billion deal to acquire NinjaTrader, described as the biggest crypto TradFi acquisition to date.\nAdvertisement",

               "title": "UCLA Anderson December 2025 Forecast Finds a Slowing But Resilient National Economy, Buffeted By Investment In AI, Continues To Face Tariff-Related Uncertainties",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Image by 2211438 from Pixabay  \nKey takeaways \nDecember 3, 2025 - By Paul Feinberg - The December 2025 UCLA Anderson Forecast for the U.S. and California describes a situation in which two economic trends currently are working in opposition. In some sectors, ongoing and optimistic investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure and rising income among high-wealth households are driving the economy, but tariff-induced inflation, policy-driven uncertainty and a gradually weakening labor market indicate signs of sectoral weakness. \nRelated from October Report: UCLA Anderson Forecast Finds Weakness Persists in U.S. and California Economies: Risk of Rising Layoffs Leading to a Recession is a Tangible Possibility \nPublished in December: Stanislaus State Fall 2025 San Joaquin Valley Business Forecast: California’s Central Valley Faces Rising Recession Risks As Tariffs, Slowing Employment Growth and Heightened Financial Stress Continue To Weigh On Business and Consumer Confidence \nThe result is an economy expected to soften through the first quarter of 2026 before regaining strength later in the year. \nIn California, the outlook is further complicated by a bifurcated economy in which AI, aerospace and other high-productivity sectors continue to expand while construction, non-durable goods, leisure and hospitality, and government-funded services face significant headwinds. Deportations, elevated input costs and weak job growth are prolonging an employment recession expected to last into early 2026, even as the state continues to outpace the nation in overall productivity. \nOn balance, the forecast does not expect an immediate downturn or immediate resurgence. Instead, both the nation and the state are poised to muddle through early 2026 before experiencing stronger growth in 2026 and 2027. \nThe national forecast highlights a slowing but resilient economy significantly buffeted by sizable capital expenditures underway in AI infrastructure. The Forecast notes that projected AI-related investment in 2025 — originally estimated at $250 billion — has already surpassed $405 billion, with further increases expected in 2026. Fiscal stimulus from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to reinforce this investment surge. \nAt the same time, tariffs imposed throughout 2025 continue to move through supply chains, raising the price of goods and placing pressure on consumers and small businesses. The ongoing policy uncertainty — including anticipated Supreme Court decisions on tariffs — has made long-term planning difficult for firms and has contributed to a cautious hiring environment. \nEmployment growth has slowed sharply, and unemployment is expected to inch up to 4.5% by the end of 2025, though unemployment insurance claims remain low. Inflation is projected to peak at 3.5% (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in early 2026, driven largely by pass-through from earlier tariff hikes, before gradually declining but remaining above target. \nInterest rates have stabilized: Long-term rates are expected to remain near 4.0%–4.4% as structural pressures — including elevated public deficits, aging demographics and heavy borrowing linked to AI investments — prevent a return to pre-pandemic lows. \nOverall GDP growth will soften in late 2025 and early 2026, exacerbated by temporary effects from the record-setting 43-day federal government shutdown. Later in 2026, growth is expected to rebound meaningfully as both fiscal and monetary stimuli take hold. \nAt present, California’s economy continues to outpace the nation’s in high-productivity sectors such as AI, aerospace and advanced manufacturing, buoyed by the state’s disproportionate share of venture capital investment. Nearly 70% of all U.S. venture funding in early 2025 went to California, and 7 of the 10 largest investment deals in the Americas this year occurred in-state. \nBut this strength masks a growing divide. Construction, nondurable goods manufacturing, retail, and leisure and hospitality remain under pressure from federal spending reductions, tariffs, elevated costs and the early effects of deportation policies. Payroll job losses through the first eight months of 2025 marked the first sustained decline since the pandemic, and California’s unemployment rate has remained above 5.0% for more than 19 consecutive months. \nThe Forecast’s analysis of historical immigration restrictions suggests that deportations tend to raise unemployment among U.S.-born and documented workers through reduced consumption and disruptions in complementary occupations. Early county-level data in California show this pattern beginning to emerge, especially in counties with higher shares of foreign-born workers employed in construction, agriculture and hospitality. \nHousing remains a significant constraint. Building permits have stayed subdued despite elevated home prices and the urgent need for new construction following the December 2024 and January 2025 wildfires. Workforce shortages tied to deportations, tariff-driven input costs and persistently high financing costs all contribute to slow progress in residential building. \nGoods movement offers a bright spot: Air cargo volume has begun to recover to pre-pandemic levels in both Northern and Southern California, reflecting steady demand in higher-income households and businesses linked to the state’s technology sector. \nThe December forecast calls for a gradual improvement beginning in late 2026: \n2025: 5.5% \n2026: 5.5% \n2027: 4.6% \n2025: 0.6% \n2026: 0.7% \n2027: 2.0% \n2025: 0.0% \n2026: -0.1% \n2027: 1.9% \n2025: 1.8% \n2026: 1.1% \n2027: 2.6% \n2025: 101,000 \n2027: 121,000 \nThe UCLA Anderson Forecast is one of the most widely watched and often-cited economic outlooks for California and the nation and was unique in predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and the strength of the state’s rebound since 1993. The forecast was credited as the first major U.S. economic forecasting group to call the recession of 2001 and, in March 2020, it was the first to declare that the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had already begun. \nSource: UCLA Anderson Forecast",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " LONDON, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Transurban Finance Company Pty Ltd (the ”Offeror”) announces today the pricing and early acceptance results of its offer to purchase for cash certain of its outstanding US$550,000,000 3.375% Guaranteed Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (CUSIP: 89400PAG8/Q9194UAW2, ISIN: US89400PAG81/USQ9194UAW29) (the ”Notes”), issued by the Offeror and guaranteed by Transurban Holdings Limited, Transurban International Limited and Transurban Infrastructure Management Limited in its capacity as responsible entity of the Transurban Holding Trust, and Transurban Limited (the ”Offer”). The terms and conditions of the Offer are set out in the offer to purchase, dated November 17, 2025 (the ”Offer to Purchase”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this announcement have the same meaning as assigned to them in the Offer to Purchase. \nOn December 3, 2025, the Offeror announced the early participation results of the Offer and the increase to the Maximum Acceptance Amount to US$118,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes. As set out below, the Offeror expects to accept for purchase US$118,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes for an aggregate purchase price (excluding the Accrued Interest Payments (as defined below)) of US$117,831,660. Because the principal amount of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline exceeded the Maximum Acceptance Amount, the Offeror intends to accept for purchase Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline on a prorated basis as described in the Offer to Purchase, using the scaling factor of approximately 45.676%. \nThe pricing of the Offer took place at or around 10:00 a.m., New York City time, today (the ”Price Determination Date”). \nThe following table sets forth the early acceptance results, certain pricing information and the Early Tender Offer Consideration for the Offer: \nThe settlement date for the Notes validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase by the Offeror is expected to be December 5, 2025, unless extended by the Offeror (the ”Early Settlement Date”). Noteholders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid interest on the relevant Notes, if any (the ”Accrued Interest Payment”). \nAlthough the Offer will finally expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 17, 2025, unless extended by the Offeror (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the ”Expiration Deadline”), as the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline was greater than the aggregate principal amount of Notes that is equivalent to the Maximum Acceptance Amount, no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase. \nThe Offeror is making the Offer as part of a refinancing of certain of its existing debt. The Offer, together with the tender offers for two series of notes outstanding under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme settled on November 27, 2025, and the offering of debt securities that commenced substantially concurrently with the Offer and closed on November 26, 2025, are intended to extend the Offeror’s debt maturity profile. The settlement of the issuance in the Euro bond market (the ”New Notes”) on November 26, 2025 (London time), satisfied the financing condition to the Offer. \nFurther information \nNoteholders are advised to read carefully the Offer to Purchase for full details of and information on the procedures for participating in the Offer. Noteholders may access the Offer to Purchase at https://deals.is.kroll.com/transurban-usd. \nDealer Manager: \nNOTICE AND DISCLAIMER \nThis press release is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the Notes or any other securities.

President Donald Trump will be joined by the CEOs of Chrysler-parent Stellantis and Ford Motor to unveil the proposal. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Editing by Franklin Paul)",

We have seen risks arise over potential overbuild, concentration among certain off-takers, and questions about whether returns will materialize. But it’s early days--the story of AI is still being written. Winners have yet to be defined” \nUMESH SUBRAMANIAN, CITADEL CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER \n”We try to make sure that AI doesn’t go into the land of prediction. It goes into the land of seeing today clearly.” \nBRENDAN COUGHLIN, PRESIDENT OF CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP \n”The industry is ripe for further consolidation and a lot of this tech discussion we’ve had is going to favor folks with more scale. There’s been some M&A in 2025. There’s a lot of discussion around that heating up. I think you know (by) December 31, 2026, there will be less deals than people imagine.” \nView the live broadcast of the World Stage here and read full coverage here. \n(Compiled by Pritam Biswas and Ateev Bhandari in Bengaluru; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

               "title": "Spain won’t use bulk of EU recovery fund loans as economy growing fast, minister says",
               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " TORONTO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Spain will use only about a quarter of European Union loans meant to help EU members recover from the 2020-21 pandemic as its fast-growing economy can issue debt without EU curbs and deadlines, its economy minister told Reuters on Wednesday. \nWhile Spain has been spared any noticeable direct impact from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on the EU, it is still working to diversify trade and investment relationships, Carlos Cuerpo said during a visit to Canada. \nCountries including Italy, Poland and Spain have yet to use EU recovery funds that include grants and loans and must be implemented by August 2026, subject to EU regulations. \nSpain was one of the main recipients and had been due to receive around 160 billion euros ($187 billion) - roughly half in grants and half in loans. \n”Financially, there is no advantage for us to go for those loans, because we can do it ourselves with our own issuance of debt,” Cuerpo said. \nSpain’s economy has by far outgrown its European peers in the past two years, diminishing its public debt burden as a share of GDP. \nHe said Spain had focused on the direct EU transfers to boost sectors including green energy, and might ultimately spend just around 25% of the loans. \n”We will be closing these negotiations with the (European)Commission in the next few days, but it will be around that figure, yes, maybe a bit higher,” Cuerpo said. \nSince the exposure of Spanish exports to the U.S. market is lower than that of other EU partners, Cuerpo said, ”there is no significant impact” at the macroeconomic level from the U.S. tariffs, but did not rule out that a ”potential impact might come from an indirect channel, from France, from Germany”. \nThe EU signed a deal with Trump involving a baseline tariff of 15% on most EU goods. The International Monetary Fund has said Spain is less affected than other large EU economies. \nMeanwhile, Cuerpo said he thought bilateral trade with Canada could be doubled and voiced confidence a trade agreement between the Mercosur bloc of South American countries and the EU would be signed before the end of the year. \n(Reporting by Caroline Stauffer; editing by Andrei Khalip and Mark Heinrich) \nBy Caroline Stauffer",

               "title": "Excise collected from tobacco to be shared with States: Finance Minister",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said tax revenues collected from excise duty on tobacco and related products will be part of the divisible pool, and 41 per cent of that will be shared with the states. \nReplying to the debate on the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said this is not an additional tax, and the same tax burden, as currently applicable under the GST regime, will continue. The bill seeks to levy excise duty on tobacco, related products. “This is not an additional tax. \nThis is not something which the Centre is taking away. This is not a cess. This is excise duty. It existed before GST... It is coming back to the Centre, to be collected as excise duty, which will go to the divisible pool. It is going to be redistributed again at the 41 per cent which has to go to the states,” Sitharaman said. \nEarlier moving the Bill for consideration and passage in Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said the levy of excise on tobacco will ensure that the tax incidence on the demerit good remains the same even after the expiry of the GST compensation cess. Sitharaman said since the GST law caps maximum rate of tax at 40 per cent, the ultimate tax incidence on tobacco after removal of GST cess would come down from the current level if excise duty is \nnot levied. “In order to ensure that the incidence is not lower than what it was during GST with the compensation cess, we are bringing this excise. In a way, we are saying cigarettes should not become affordable now because incidence has become less,” the minister said. The bill will replace the GST compensation cess, which is currently levied on all tobacco products like cigarettes, chewing tobacco, cigars, hookah, zarda, and scented tobacco. Currently, a 28 per cent GST plus cess at a varied rate is levied on tobacco. The bill proposes to levy an excise duty of 60-70 per cent on unmanufactured tobacco. Excise on cigars and cheroots is proposed at 25 per cent or `5,000 per 1,000 sticks, whichever is higher. \nCigarettes, not having filters, and of length not over 65 millimetres, will attract duty of `2,700 per 1,000 sticks and `4,500 per 1,000 sticks for length over 65 millimetres but not exceeding 70 millimetres. Sitharaman further said the bill was necessary as the loan taken to meet the revenue loss of states during Covid will be repaid in a “couple of weeks”, post which the compensation cess will cease to exist. \n“In another, probably, couple of weeks, the loans will be completely repaid.” The Centre, therefore, wants to make sure that the excise will come back to us so that we can levy the duty,” Sitharaman said. At the time of the introduction of the GST on July 1, 2017, a compensation cess mechanism was put in place for 5 years till June 30, 2022, to make up for the revenue loss suffered by states on account of GST implementation. \nThe levy of compensation cess was later extended by 4 years till March 31, 2026, and the collection is being used to repay the `2.69 lakh crore loan that the Centre took to compensate states for the GST revenue loss during the Covid period. Lok Sabha, later, passed the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, by a voice vote. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman speaks in the Lok Sabha during the Winter session of Parliament on Wednesday.",

The potential tax stems from the English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill, which includes a clause permitting local leaders to “raise revenue locally through a new overnight visitor levy.” While there has been no official declaration of the specifics, many suggest the levy could be 5% per night. that introducing a tourist tax “is the start of a bigger of devolving tax and spending powers to the capital.”A spokesperson for Khan told Local Democracy Reporting Service, “The mayor has been clear a modest tourist levy, similar to other international cities.”“London is the most productive big city in the U.K., and devolving more fiscal powers would give the capital more policy tools to accelerate growth in the economy,” said Carter.Bold purple chalk signs on the edge of some sidewalks say, “Mind the Grab,” and “Step back from the Kerb! Phone snatching hot spot.” The latest news comes as European cities and other destinations have been grappling with overtourism. Greek officials, for example, are planning to impose a $22 tax on visitors cruising to Santorini or Mykonos.The City of Edinburgh, Scotland, plans to charge a 5% per night tax on accommodations starting in July 2026.
