The site polled 2,049 adults in December 2024.\nHere’s how to gear up your finances for the end of 2025 and prepare for the new year, according to experts. \n’The most crucial and impactful tax strategies’\nWhile the deadline for individual tax returns falls in April, ”the most crucial and impactful tax strategies” often need to happen before December 31, said Chelsea Ransom-Cooper, a CFP, co-founder and the chief planning officer of Zenith Wealth Partners in Philadelphia.\nThis year, year-end tax planning is even more important, given that President Donald Trump’s ” big beautiful bill ” made several tax law changes, said Ransom-Cooper, a member of CNBC’s Financial Advisor Council . \nwatch now\nFinancial Advisor 100\nFor instance, the law temporarily increased the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes , or SALT, to $40,000 for 2025, up from $10,000. \nThat higher cap is a ”completely different ball game for a lot of people,” Ransom-Cooper said. Maximizing it may require strategizing — say, by prepaying certain taxes.\nOn the other hand, there’s a new tax break worth up to $2,000 for cash charitable donations for non-itemizers, said Moisand. However, the law doesn’t take effect until January — which means some taxpayers may benefit from delaying small year-end charitable gifts until the new year.\n”The biggest mistake is just thinking of each tax year in isolation without considering the levers that you could pull,” Moisand said.\n’The last thing you want’ for 2026\nUse these last months of the year to think about where you are financially and what your goals are for the future, said Cisneros, a member of CNBC’s Financial Advisor Council . That can help keep your spending on track.\nThis year, early forecasts show that worries about higher costs from inflation and tariffs may prompt consumers to pull back.\nAbout 41% of consumers are concerned that gifts will be more expensive this year and 30% said they expect to spend less this holiday than they did last year, according to a recent report by Bankrate.\nThink about different ways to get ahead and avoid overspending, like taking advantage of sales or finding other ways beyond gifts to express care and appreciation for others, Cisneros said. \n”The last thing you want is to start 2026 with a lot of stress financially,” she said. \nCNBC receives no compensation from placing financial advisory firms on our  Financial Advisor 100 list .

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " (The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) \nJoseph J. Gonzalez, Appalachian State University \n(THE CONVERSATION) The lights went out in Cuba again. \nFor the fifth time in a year, all of Cuba plunged into darkness on Sept. 10, 2025. Even critical emergency services like hospitals suffered during the nearly 24-hour power outage. \nThat’s because Cuba’s power grid is old and hard to maintain, and the country cannot afford to import all the oil it needs to keep the lights on. \nAs a scholar of Cuban society and politics, I believe that the ongoing blackouts point to larger economic problems facing the country. While much of that is due to the continuing effects of the U.S. embargo, which since 1960 has obstructed American trade and tourism with the Caribbean island, Cuba’s leaders also deserve a share of the blame for their economic mismanagement. \nIndeed, while other nominally communist countries, such as Vietnam and China, have facilitated the development of a private sphere in their economies in the past several decades, officials in Havana have in practice restricted such growth so as not to threaten state enterprises. \nThe result has been a less vibrant, less productive network of private enterprises unable to provide the economic growth that Cuba so desperately needs. All the while, Cuba’s communist government faces an existential threat as it struggles to maintain power in the face of popular discontent. \nThe external factors of the crisis \nSince 2020, Cuba’s gross domestic product has shrunk by almost 11%, with economists forecasting a further decline of 1%-2% in 2025. \nThere are a number of reasons for this decline. \nTourism, Cuba’s lifeblood, has not rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Venezuela, which subsidized Cuba for a decade in the 2000s, particularly with oil exports, no longer has the capacity to do so. Further, persistent energy shortages in Cuba have led to steep declines in agricultural and industrial production. \nFrom a broader perspective, the U.S. embargo also continues to harm the Cuban economy. For more than 60 years, Cubans have been unable to sell their products to the United States – and Americans have been unable to travel to or do business with Cuba outside of very limited categories. \nEstimates vary as to what extent the embargo damages the Cuban economy, but it seems certain that the “blockade,” as Cubans call it, deprives the nation of at least hundreds of millions, if not billions, of U.S. dollars in trade every year, most particularly in agriculture and tourism. \nSteps toward domestic reform \nWhile external factors have taken a toll, the persistent economic difficulties facing Cubans are also self-inflicted by the government. \nCuba’s leaders have pursued a slow, narrow and sometimes arbitrary path toward economic privatization – especially when contrasted with other officially communist countries in Asia. \nFollowing Fidel Castro’s departure from public life in 2008, Cuba’s subsequent leader, and Fidel’s brother, Raul Castro, announced a series of gradual steps intended to encourage private enterprise that had long been curtailed by the government. \nUnder Raul, the state allowed Cubans to own, buy and sell their homes; they could also create their own businesses, and even employ others to whom they were not related – practices prohibited under Fidel Castro. \nThe government also allowed more foreigners to invest in Cuba, principally in tourist infrastructure, provided they confined themselves to minority stakes. \nCubans were also permitted for the first time in decades to own their own land, grow food and sell it at markets, setting their own prices within limits. Collective farms, the bane of Soviet agriculture that had once inspired Fidel’s revolutionary visions, were no longer the norm. \nBy 2017, about 13% of the workforce held licenses to start businesses, while the private sector employed about one-third of all workers. \nIn the years immediately following these reforms, Cuba posted some gains in industrial and food production and GDP. Indeed, during the mid-2000s, Cuba posted impressive growth rates, sometimes in excess of 10%. \nDomestic progress stalled \nUnfortunately for Cubans, the upward trend did not continue. \nAnd that is in no small measure due to Cuba’s prosperity in the 2000s being built on Venezuelan subsidies, not by Cuban entrepreneurs. \nVenezuela’s late president, and longtime Castro admirer, Hugo Chavez, began to subsidize Fidel Castro’s government shortly after taking power in 1999. \nA petrostate, Venezuela provided much-needed oil to Cuba on favorable terms, while also paying the Cuban nation for doctors to work in Venezuela’s hospitals and clinics, providing Cuba with the hard currency it needed to pay for imports. \nResearchers estimate that the Venezuelan government subsidized the Cuban economy by as much as US$9 billion per year until 2016. \nVenezuelan oil allowed Cuba to paper over a starker reality: Despite reforms, Cuba’s entrepreneurs remained hamstrung by a cumbersome and often corrupt state policy. \nThanks to ever-changing regulations, the majority of private businesses have remained small and dedicated to personal services, such as restaurants, hairdressing, seamstressing and repairs. \nOn a larger scale, Cuba’s state bureaucrats see competition with government-owned businesses, especially in tourism, as a threat to their power and privileges. Taxes also remain inequitably high for private firms. \nMeanwhile, the larger private businesses that are now occasionally permitted are almost always, according to a number of my Cuban-based sources, connected to friends or family members of the political elite, not average Cubans. \nThere have been successes, to be sure. The private sector now accounts for more retail sales by volume than state enterprises. \nBut the percentage of the workforce employed by the private sector remains about what it was in 2019, while private enterprise accounts for only about 15% of Cuba’s GDP. \nThe unsustainable present \nConfronting multiple crises, Cuba’s leaders continue to blame the U.S. embargo and policy from Washington that has become only more bellicose under President Donald Trump. No doubt drawing optimism from having weathered severe crises before, the Cuban government seems committed to a state of defiance. \nBut the evidence this time around suggests Havana’s leaders should be less sanguine. \nDespite increasing costs, Cubans enjoy widespread access to the internet and they know just how bad and how inequitable things are. \nFor all the government’s rhetoric and commitment to a decades-old revolution, Cubans see a much-vaunted medical system that is failing, unable to provide drugs, procedures — or even electricity. They know that crime is on the rise, while inflation reduces the value of the Cuban peso relative to the dollar every week \nCubans see and hear of their well-connected countrymen, with links to state enterprises, flaunting their wealth. Cubans may also know that their military holds as much as US$18 billion abroad — about 16% of Cuba’s GDP in 2024. \nWhat they certainly know and experience is the reality of being forced to live without power, with no possibility of improvement in sight. \nLimited choices going forward \nHistorically, Cuba has been pulled from crises by foreign patrons willing to subsidize its revolution. \nBut Russia’s strategic position, China’s global priorities and Venezuela’s hardships all make that unlikely right now. And with the U.S. now pursuing a policy of maximum pressure against noncompliant governments in Latin America, Havana can rest assured that it will see little breathing room from its powerful neighbor and long-time antagonist. \nThat leaves the Cuban government with only a few options. \nIt could choose to continue trying to restrict its citizens’ access to the internet. Unfortunately for the state, the internet is the lifeblood of the private sector. \nCuba’s leaders could also choose to rely on the loyalty of its security forces and their ability to intimidate and abuse their fellow Cubans. That has worked in the past, but given Havana’s scarce resources and its limited capacity to reward its henchmen, it is not clear that the government can afford to adopt this approach indefinitely. \nOf course, Cuba’s leaders could take steps toward further reform the private sector and eliminate the waste and corruption that have increasingly defined the Cuban state. \nSuch a course would require the government to permit all Cubans, not just a well-connected few, to compete with state enterprises. It would also mean allowing for a greater degree of foreign investment, which has remained stunted due to government policy. \nIf the past offers any guide, however, Havana will instead continue to rely on its formidable security apparatus to repress is citizens, while privatizing in ways that do not threaten the power and privileges of the elite. \nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The Frankfurt-based expert brings nearly two decades of real estate finance experience and has originated deals worth approximately €2.7 billion. \n. \nThe move marks another key step in Pluto’s European expansion, following recent appointments in Spain and Ireland and the announcement of its £2 billion partnership with Blackstone to provide whole loan lending for the mid-market [we reported]. \nMax Güntner brings nearly 20 years of experience in real estate and structured finance, having originated, structured and executed transactions across all asset classes with a total debt volume of approximately €2.7 billion. Throughout his career, he has advised institutional investors, private equity sponsors and developers on sourcing and structuring financing and raising capital. He is based in Frankfurt and previously held senior roles at Deutsche Bank, Laurus Property Partners and most recently as Executive Director at 777 Financial Advisors. \nHis experience makes him ideally placed to deliver Pluto’s bespoke lending solutions across Germany and the Netherlands. The appointment also reinforces Pluto’s capabilities in key European markets. Other recent hires include Shane Ryan (Ireland, December 2024), Eduardo Martin (Spain and Portugal, early 2025), and Ciaran Singh (Managing Director Europe, April 2025). \nCiaran Singh, Managing Director Europe, commented: “Max’s arrival is another important milestone in our European growth strategy. Having established a strong presence in the UK, we have begun replicating this success across Ireland, Iberia and can now extend this to Germany and the Netherlands. These are deep real estate markets where flexible credit solutions are in demand. Max’s combination of transaction experience, a pan-European perspective, and trusted network of borrower and investor relationships will be central to our ability to build momentum quickly. His appointment underlines our commitment to attracting the strongest talent to lead our expansion.”",

               "text": "Risks in Europe’s shadow finance\nOctober 4, 2025 10:00 PM\nSHARE\n© AnnaGvarishvili / X / Fair Use\nThe non-banking sector in Europe is experiencing accelerated growth, but experts warn that this kind of development comes without adequate security measures. The European Central Bank (ECB) is now intensifying pressure on regulators to align the rules for banks and funds outside the traditional sector. Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said: ”Investment funds, despite their increasing importance, operate under significantly lighter rules than banks, which has greatly encouraged their growth.”\nAt the conference in Amsterdam, Lagarde emphasized that it is important to recognize the signs of regulatory fatigue. \n”This creates an uneven playing field and encourages the growth of risk in segments of the financial market with a lower level of supervision,” she explained. \nECB data shows that non-banking institutions in the eurozone have grown from 250 percent of the value of the economy in 2008 to more than 350 percent today. Among them are hedge funds, private equity, credit funds and asset management companies. Lagarde warns that their expansion carries risks that remain hidden in the current framework, while banks, which have to comply with complex capital and liquidity requirements, perceive the competition as unfair.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSubtitle: supervision needs\nLagarde emphasizes that balance is not achieved by lowering standards for banks; it is necessary to raise the standards for non-banking institutions that do banking work or are strongly connected to the sector. \nWhile Europe is considering tighter supervision of investment funds, the US is going the other way, liberalizing rules after the 2008 crisis. Lagarde warns: \n”Decision makers must not wait for another crisis to remind them how high the stakes are.”\nThe ECB currently oversees 114 of the largest banks in the eurozone and has set up a task force to simplify capital and reporting requirements. The data shows record levels of capital in alternative funds, particularly private equity and private debt markets. Lagarde concludes: \n”It is imperative to extend supervision to non-banks that carry out banking activities - sooner rather than later,” adding that ”this time, unlike in 2008, there may not be a bailout.”\nSHARE",

               "text": " HANOI (Reuters) -Vietnam’s government said on Sunday its economy grew at an annual rate of 8.22% in the third quarter, when a 20% tariff on U.S. imports of its products took effect, accelerating from growth of 7.96% in the second quarter. \n”It is the highest quarterly growth since 2011, excluding the surge in 2022 due to recovery post COVID-19 pandemic,” the government statement said, citing Finance Minister Nguyen Van Thang. \nSunday’s economic release did not include trade data, a key variable as a 20% U.S. import tariff on most Vietnamese goods imposed by the Trump administration took effect on August 7, mid-way through the quarter. \nThe National Statistics Office is expected to release a full set of economic data, including trade figures, on Monday. \nPrime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said last month Vietnam expected exports to grow more than 12% this year, following a United Nations Development Programme report saying that U.S. duties risked slashing by up to one-fifth of Vietnam’s exports to the United States, making it the hardest-hit country in Southeast Asia. \nVietnam would continue trade negotiations with the United States, the government and its trade ministry have said. \nThe third quarter was also marked by severe weather disruptions, with eight storms hitting the country, including Typhoon Bualoi, which caused an estimated 16.5 trillion dong ($625.5 million) in damage. \nOver the first nine months of the year, GDP grew 7.84% compared to the same period in 2024, according to the government. \nVietnam is targeting gross domestic product growth of 8.3%-8.5% this year. That is faster than last year’s 7.09% growth, and higher than the World Bank’s forecast of 6.6% and the International Monetary Fund’s estimate of 6.5% growth. \nThe country’s 2025 growth faces headwinds from external economic pressures, slow-moving reforms and escalating natural disasters, which are expected to worsen in the final months of the year, the government statement added. \nConsumer prices rose 3.27% year-on-year in the January-September period, with September inflation at 3.38%, it said. \n($1 = 26,380.0000 dong) \n(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen; Editing by Jamie Freed and Lincoln Feast.)",
