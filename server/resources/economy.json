               "text": "Express Computer\nA password will be e-mailed to you.\nTuesday, October 7, 2025\nHome  »  Guest Blogs  »  How account aggregation is redefining credit underwriting in India’s digital economy\nHow account aggregation is redefining credit underwriting in India’s digital economy\nShare\nBy Venkatesh Krishnamoorti, Founder, Saafe\nIndia’s financial sector is among the most diverse in the world, with an enormous range of providers serving equally varied consumers. At one end of the spectrum are large public and private sector banks offering everything from secured business loans to unsecured personal credit. At the other, local moneylenders continue to meet small-ticket needs. Between them operate cooperative banks, regional rural banks, small finance banks, NBFCs, and microfinance institutions.\nWhile products, customers, and delivery models differ, one process unites them all — credit underwriting. It lies at the heart of every lending decision, determining whether a borrower is eligible for credit and under what terms. Lenders traditionally rely on parameters like the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR), credit score, cash flow patterns, and residence stability to evaluate applicants.\nLoan applications arrive through multiple channels — branches, direct selling agents (DSAs), digital platforms, and proprietary loan journeys. Historically, most branch and DSA applications were paper-based. Applicants filled forms, self-attested documents, and submitted physical copies. These were then couriered or scanned and sent to regional or head-office credit teams. Depending on the loan amount, applications travelled through several approval layers, taking anywhere from three to fifteen days to reach a decision.\nIf rejected, borrowers often turned to the next lender in line — typically at a higher cost of borrowing.\nThe Shift Toward Instant and Digital\nThat once-reasonable turnaround time now feels painfully slow. In a world where groceries arrive in ten minutes, borrowers expect loans to move just as fast. The 1990s introduced India to ATMs, net banking, and credit cards. The 2010s brought UPI and mobile banking, which revolutionised how people transact and manage finances.\nToday, customers rarely visit bank branches — they invest, transfer, and spend entirely online. The question naturally follows: why should borrowing remain old-fashioned?\nFor lenders, too, the manual model is a drag on efficiency and risk management. Armies of employees manually verifying reams of documents is neither scalable nor secure. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools improved speed but were far from perfect. The result was predictable — fraudulent or doctored PDFs slipping through the cracks, leading to rising losses, particularly in unsecured loans.\nThis “paper trail problem” demanded a structural fix.\nEnter Account Aggregation: India’s Data Revolution in Motion\nImagine a credit system where lenders access verified financial data — such as bank statements, deposits, and asset holdings — directly from the source, with user consent.\nNo photocopies, no middlemen, no fraud. That is the promise of Account Aggregation (AA) — a consent-based data-sharing framework regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The first Master Directions were released in 2016, and the ecosystem officially went live on September 2, 2021.\nThrough secure APIs, AAs enable individuals to share their financial data across institutions digitally, end-to-end encrypted, and only after explicit consent. For lenders, this is a game-changer.\nThe benefits are far-reaching:\n•End-to-end secure and consent-driven data flow\n•Real-time access to verified financial information\n•Elimination of document fraud and errors\n•Decisioning time reduced from days to minutes\n•Substantial drop in operational overheads\n•Richer analytics through triangulation of data across sources.\nWhat was once a 10–15 day process can now happens in as little as 10 minutes — a coincidence that rivals delivery apps, but with far greater impact on economic productivity.\nEarly Adopters and the Momentum Ahead\nThe AA ecosystem started gradually — as with every great innings, even legends like Viv Richards or Brian Lara needed time to build momentum. But its growth trajectory today is unmistakable.\nForward-looking institutions such as Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, and Navi have already integrated AAs into their credit journeys, realising faster loan processing, improved fraud detection, and superior customer experience. Many others are actively building digital underwriting models around this infrastructure.\nThe shift is no longer about if, but how fast India’s lenders can transition to an AA-first model. In a data-rich economy where trust, transparency, and turnaround time define competitiveness, Account Aggregation may well become the new credit backbone of the decade.\nThe Road to a Paperless Future\nAs the AA ecosystem scales, its implications go beyond credit. It represents a foundational layer of India’s digital public infrastructure, complementing UPI, Aadhaar, and OCEN. By allowing individuals to securely share and control their data, AAs empower citizens while unlocking enormous efficiency gains for the financial system.\nIt’s a future where physical passbooks, cheque books, and couriered loan files belong in museums — and consent-based data rails drive India’s next leap in financial inclusion.",

               "text": "New masters aims to bolster blue economy\nEducation & academia +1 more\n7 October 2025, at 7:49am\nA new marine science masters course which includes extra employability skills training and a fifth year working with a programme partner in sectors such as aquaculture, marine technology, scientific diving, conservation and marine renewables, has been rolled out by the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) in Oban.\nThis year’s MSc intake at SAMS\n© SAMS\nThe Applied Marine Science MSci straddles the institute’s BSc (Hons) Marine Science but was developed in response to a need for a more skilled workforce as the blue economy develops in Scotland and the wider UK.\nProgramme leader Dr Arlene Ditchfield of SAMS said in a press release: “There’s never been a more vital time to study marine science. Our oceans face urgent challenges: climate change, biodiversity loss, and the unsustainable use of precious resources. \n“As society attempts to provide solutions to address our impact on the environment, various industries and sectors will require more graduates with the knowledge and skills to tackle these issues head-on.\n“This new course blends academic excellence with hands-on experience, ensuring that graduates can bring an holistic and informed perspective to the world of work.”\nThe inaugural intake of 16 students exceeded expectation but, says Dr Ditchfield, shows the appetite for higher education courses that relate directly to the world of work.\nThe Applied Marine Science MSci has partnered with companies throughout Scotland, including SAMS Enterprise, the commercial arm of SAMS, to allow students to match up with their preferred programme partner and build connections before their final year placement. \nSteve Ham, head of SAMS Enterprise, said: “In order to fully develop the emerging blue economy, creating new services and markets that operate in harmony with the marine environment, we will need scientific expertise.\n“I’m therefore delighted that SAMS is taking forward this unique MSci opportunity. SAMS Enterprise is fully behind the aims and objectives of the course and I’m excited to see how these highly-skilled and informed graduates will benefit industry.”\nAnother partner is the community-led organisation the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST). Executive director, Aine Purcell-Milton said: “We look forward to partnering on the new MSci Applied Marine Science programme and supporting academic study into real-world marine conservation and protection.\n“The programme is set up to give students the necessary skills, experience and knowledge to make a real difference, at a time when our marine environment needs it most.”\nDr Kelly James, benthic ecology and modelling adviser on the Marine Ecosystems Team at Nature Scot, said: “We’re excited to see how NatureScot can engage in the new SAMS Applied Marine Science MSci and shape opportunities to gain hands-on experience in looking after Scotland’s amazing marine environment.” \nDr Martin Sayer, managing director of programme partner Tritonia Scientific, said: “At Tritonia, we are committed to supporting the next generation of marine scientists and are excited to offer a placement opportunity to a SAMS MSci Applied Marine Science student.”\nIain Eisner of UHI Futures, which supports students in careers and employability, said: “From the employer’s point of view this is filling a gap in the sector. \n“The course content was designed with input from employers, which I think is a big plus point for the course. It means the content is unique and focused on an attractive and growing sector that will have a lot of need for the skillset these students will possess.”\nFor more information on the Applied Marine Science MSci and studying at SAMS, visit: MSc (Integrated) Applied Marine Science course\nRecent features",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " In Ludwigsburg’s Weststadt district, Patron Capital and Inbright have secured financing for the LIZ (Ludwigsburg Industrial Centre). BGO is providing over €100 million to renovate and construct modern light industrial spaces on the 51,000 m² former Mann+Hummel site. \n. \nLIZ is a flexible and state-of-the-art light industrial campus. Upon completion it will provide around 100,000 sqm GLA of ESG compliant space for businesses based in the Stuttgart metropolitan region. LIZ is one of the largest construction project of its kind in Germany’s Baden-Württemberg region and the third largest in Germany. \nThe loan has been provided by BGO, a leading global lender in commercial real estate. It represents the refinancing of a facility used to acquire the LIZ site as well as a new development loan to refurbish existing buildings and the construction of new buildings on the 51,000 sqm site. “BGO is pleased to be supporting the Patron and INBRIGHT JV in delivering a best-in-class light industrial asset in Germany. This transaction is consistent with our debt investment thesis of backing high-quality, sustainable assets in sectors with strong supply-demand fundamentals, alongside proven institutional sponsors”, Laura Manthe, Managing Director of BGO’s European debt team, said. \nThe financing will enable the revitalization of the former production site of the industrial company Mann+Hummel to be driven forward: 44,500 sqm of existing buildings into pioneering energy efficient future proofed R&D and light industrial space, designed to meet modern occupational requirements with highly flexible spaces across units of multiple sizes ranging from approximately 300 sqm to large-scale single-tenant solutions of up to 75,000 sqm. A number of buildings on the site are also being dismantled and replaced with new modern properties. LIZ is being specially designed for businesses operating in the engineering, high-tech, electronics, logistics, automotive, and transportation sectors. \nRefurbishment of the existing buildings is now almost complete, with a large portion of space having already been leased. Mann+Hummel, the former owner of the site, is remaining as a long-term occupier. ISPTech, a renowned German space technology company, has also committed to the LIZ. Furthermore, occupiers from the technology and digital industrial sectors are currently in negotiations to take space at LIZ. Works are also beginning on a new 50,000 sqm sustainable building, with first phase completion expected in 2027. \nSuccessfully securing development financing is testament to LIZ’s quality and design that is comprehensively committed to the highest ESG standards. Resource conserving renovations have been undertaken and energy-efficient new buildings will encompass wood-hybrid construction. The project is aiming for DGNB gold certification and will benefit from PV systems, connection to the Ludwigsburg municipal utility district heating network, the use of green electricity, and an integrated e-mobility concept. Extensive green roofs will promote biodiversity, while recycled building materials are being used on the project.",

               "title": "Industry Perspectives: How surety could play a bigger role in trade finance",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Surety sits at the intersection of banking and insurance, and has long been used to back the performance of a contract.\n\nBut the product, which works similarly to a bank guarantee, has to date not been widely adopted in the trade sector.\n\nIn this Industry Perspective, Daniel Storr, co-head of Emea surety for insurance broker Aon, suggests that businesses conducting international trade would do well to consider the use of surety.\n\nStorr argues it can be a powerful tool to help complement existing credit lines and unlock extra liquidity for corporates.\n\nGTR: What industries has surety traditionally supported?\n\nStorr: Historically, surety was predominantly used in construction, a sector that is very experienced with the product and how it works. But during the last 10 to 15 years, there has been a lot of innovation, and because of that, surety is diversifying. The product is now doing a lot more, in addition to just construction. That’s being driven by the value creation that surety can bring. It’s now also widely used in sectors such as oil and gas, renewables and manufacturing.\n\nGTR: How can surety be used by companies involved in international trade?\n\nStorr: Its suitability depends on each individual business. But essentially, when businesses are trading and one company is providing something to somebody else, there’s a contractual obligation to deliver that product or service. If the beneficiary of that contract wants more certainty, they might ask for some form of security. Surety can be introduced to bring that security.\n\nSurety effectively gives the companies additional liquidity that they can draw upon. The surety provider will give the guarantees on the client’s behalf to the third party. For the third party, that means that they’re diversifying their risk by getting well-rated paper from insurance companies. So that gives them comfort by alleviating a counterparty risk that they may have had before.\n\nGTR: What advantages does using surety in trade have compared to guarantees, standby letters of credit and similar products provided by banks?\n\nStorr: Surety can provide additional liquidity on top of existing trade finance or other credit lines. The advantage is that you’re not restricting or replacing banking capacity, but instead complementing it and allowing that working capital to be used for other purposes. When a company uses bank capacity, quite often it will be counted as debt, whereas surety can be considered a contingent liability. That has obvious benefits for businesses.\n\nGTR: How much appetite and capacity are there among insurers for expanding surety to a broader range of risks?\n\nStorr: The level of appetite insurers will have depends on the sector, the strength of applicant and the bond requirement itself. Sureties can support a wide range of requirements. As one example, surety insurers support decommissioning obligations that extend to 20 to 30 years, or longer.\n\nFor well-capitalised and well-managed businesses, there’s always been strong surety support available. At the moment, we’re seeing more capacity come into the market and a lot more interest from new providers, which is great. Surety providers are also looking at expanding their offering overseas, which is essential for the growth of the market and for expansion in international trade.\n\nThere have been challenges. During Covid-19, there was a contraction in capacity because lots of businesses had to shut down or curtail their operations, and surety providers, having suffered an increase in claims activity, needed to get comfortable with what they could support. And some markets are still largely bank-led, such as the Middle East. But that just means we can put together deals that work alongside banks, and facilitate trade that way.\n\nGTR: How has Aon supported the development of surety products to cater for clients’ trade needs?\n\nStorr: Surety can provide off-the-shelf products, like construction or performance bonds. In those cases, the requirements are obvious – you’re guaranteeing that one party will deliver something for another party. But outside of that, it’s really about understanding what the client needs and how extra liquidity can support their business. Once you have that, you can tailor solutions.\n\nFor example, we use surety as a negotiation tool. A client might want to push out their payment terms. If they can bring cash in sooner but delay paying it out, that’s cash flow positive. Surety can back them up by guaranteeing to their customer that obligations will be met, whether that’s a payment, service or performance. That guarantee might not be part of the original contract, but introducing it can help the client negotiate better terms.\n\nWe’ve also seen clients bring in surety simply because they want certainty. During Covid-19, and again with the energy crisis, volatility drove price fluctuations and inflation. The challenge for businesses was that if you can’t control variable costs, it’s hard to protect margins. Having surety in place to support purchasing became essential.\n\nThe post Industry Perspectives: How surety could play a bigger role in trade finance appeared first on Global Trade Review (GTR).",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " A worker cuts lumber at a saw mill near Sooke, British Columbia, on April 11, 2025. \nJames MacDonald/Bloomberg/Getty Images \nThe status quo is not going to cut it for Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at his Tuesday meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington. \nWith an unemployment rate of 7.1%, the highest level in nine years and half a percentage point higher since the start of this year, Canada’s economy is faltering. Steep tariffs Trump slapped on cars, steel and aluminum — key Canadian exports to the United States — are making matters worse. \nAnd Carney’s meeting is happening just as Trump is prepared to deal another blow to the Canadian economy: tariffs on softwood and lumber, among the top goods the US imports from their northern neighbors. \n“It makes a difference to have face-to-face time with Trump,” said Inu Manak, a senior fellow for international trade at the Council on Foreign Relations. The pressure is on Carney to leverage it. \nCanada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney last met face-to-face with President Donald Trump at the G7 meeting in August. \nJames Park/Reuters \nThe short-term stakes: tariffs \nCanadians are increasingly concerned about the cost of living and the overarching state of the economy, according to a poll conducted last week by Abacus Data of 1,500 adults, who ranked the top issues facing Canada. \n“There is a necessity on the part of the (Canadian) government to shift away from so much of the focus on Trump and being anti-Trump and really think about what they can do to improve the lives of Canadians day-to-day,” Manak said. \nTariffs on exports to the US can still raise prices for Canadians because the raw materials cross borders to produce finished goods, said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to impose 10% tariffs on lumber imports beginning next week. \nJames MacDonald/Bloomberg/Getty Images \nThat’s why Carney is likely hoping to get Trump on board with new exemptions to sectoral tariffs to help improve Canadian incomes, Manak and Schott said. \nBigger-picture stakes: trade relations with the US \nSectoral tariffs are relatively low-hanging fruit under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump brokered during his first term and will be under mandatory review next year. \nEven with the higher border levies Trump has enacted, goods from Mexico and Canada have been able to come into the US duty-free if they are USMCA compliant. Trump reportedly has been aiming to use the higher tariffs he’s enacted on non-compliant Mexican and Canadian goods to sway USMCA negotiations. \n“What is at risk is the continuation of that deal or the slow unraveling of that,” said Schott. Carney and Trump on Tuesday could give crucial clues about USMCA’s next chapter. \nBut ultimately, Manak is not expecting Trump to renew the trilateral agreement and instead expects him to dangle it as “endless leverage” in trade talks with the two nations. \nFor Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, that means they need to negotiate now with an eye to possible bilateral agreements in the future﻿.",

               "title": "American Farm Bureau Federation: Declining Farm Economy Continues to Pressure Profitability",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " October 7, 2025 - By Faith Parum - For most of the country, farmers face a difficult farm economy – as crop prices continue to decline and production expenses remain high. Strong yields provide little relief and imbalance in the market has driven profit margins to the point where breaking even is unachievable. Commodity prices have plummeted from their 2022 highs, creating a persistent imbalance in the farm economy that places real strain on the financial health of row crop farmers across the country. \nCommodity Prices Declining \nAfter the high prices of 2021 and 2022 driven by strong global demand, persistent drought and supply chain disruptions driven geopolitical tensions, markets have cooled. Corn that once topped $7 per bushel is closer to $4 today, down 54%. Soybeans have slipped below $10 per bushel after running at $15 just three years ago (decrease of 58%). Wheat prices have decreased 51% despite weather worries and cotton has come down 42% from COVID-19 pandemic highs. \nOne of the biggest drivers has been export demand. China, once the largest customer for U.S. soybeans, has shifted heavily toward South America, especially Brazil, where farmers harvested record crops at competitive prices. \nProduction Expenses Squeezing Farmers \nAs crop revenues continue to decline, expenses remain stubbornly high, leaving farmers with very few options beyond drawing down equity, tapping reserves or taking on more costly debt. Production expenses in 2025 are projected at record levels of $467 billion, nearly $12 billion higher than 2024 (up 2.6%), $50 billion above the previous five-year average (12%) and $85 billion above the previous ten-year average (21%). Each major cost category tells the same story: inputs remain elevated, eroding profitability and making it harder for farmers to reinvest in their operations or build financial reserves. \nSeed \nSeed is a critical part of farm production budgets, with U.S. farmers expected to spend $27.2 billion in 2025, about 6% of total expenses. Modern seed technology offers advantages such as pest resistance and higher yield potential, but those traits come at a premium. Although USDA data show seed costs have remained relatively steady in recent years, they are not an expense farmers can easily reduce. Cutting back on seed quality risks lower yields, making seed a necessary and consistent cost for most operations. \nCrop Protection \nHerbicide, fungicide and insecticide programs are also becoming more complex and expensive. Many active ingredients must be imported, leaving U.S. farmers exposed to global supply disruptions. Crop protection expenses in 2025 are projected at $20.6 billion, or 4% of total costs, underscoring how resistance and global volatility feed directly into farm budgets. Crop protection is a necessary input that farms rely on to grow healthy crops without damage from pests and disease. U.S. farmers remain global leaders in efficient and responsible use of crop protection products, growing more per acre with fewer inputs than many of their competitors. \nEnergy and Fuel \nEnergy is another essential expense that has proven difficult to control. Diesel fuel powers planting and harvest, while propane is critical for drying grain. Global oil price swings ripple through to the farm gate, and higher freight costs further increase the price of both inputs and marketing crops. Fuel and oil are projected at $15.8 billion in 2025, about 3% of all costs, keeping energy a meaningful line item even when oil markets stabilize. \nMachinery and Repairs \nFarmers are also facing higher costs to keep machinery running. New equipment is increasingly expensive with deliveries often delayed, leading many growers to extend the life of tractors and combines. With downturns in the ag economy, many farmers are choosing to put off the large capital expense of new equipment until their margins improve. The tradeoff is higher repair and maintenance bills. Inflation in parts and service has made routine upkeep more costly, pushing total maintenance expenses to $22.2 billion, about 5% of costs in 2025. For farm families already managing thin margins, those costs can no longer be considered minor. \nFertilizer \nFertilizer is one of the most significant drivers of cost. Although prices have retreated from the 2022 peak, they remain well above pre-2021 levels. Global supply chains, natural gas (a component fertilizer manufacturing) markets and geopolitical instability all feed into unpredictable price swings, creating uncertainty for farmers. Because fertilizer is traded in a global market, U.S. farmers compete with growers overseas who need fertilizer for growing crops like coffee that are not widely grown domestically. Strong prices for those commodities sustain global fertilizer demand, keeping input costs elevated in the U.S. even as commodity prices weaken. Fertilizer is forecast at $33.5 billion in 2025, about 7% of all expenses, representing one of the largest single costs for row crop operations. \nLand Costs \nCash rents and farmland values are at record highs, reflecting the pressure of limited supply and continued demand for productive land. Rent alone is projected at $15.2 billion in 2025, about 3% of total expenses, making it one of the largest fixed costs for many row cropgrowers. For beginning farmers, high land values create a barrier to entry, while tenants face tight margins as rents absorb more of their crop revenue. \nInterest \nHigher interest rates are hitting farmers on two fronts, raising the cost of short-term operating loans needed to cover seasonal input purchases, while also raising the cost of long-term investments in land or equipment. Interest payments are expected to reach $33.1 billion in 2025, roughly 7% of all costs, directly reducing farm profitability. For highly leveraged operations, interest is now one of the biggest threats to financial stability. \nLabor \nAlthough row crops are heavily mechanized, labor remains essential during planting and harvest. Skilled workers are increasingly difficult to find and wages continue to rise in tight rural labor markets. Labor expenses are projected at $53.7 billion, or 11% of total costs in 2025, making labor the second-largest cost category after livestock feed. For larger operations, labor shortages and higher costs are now a central challenge to maintaining efficiency. \nProfitability Outlook for the Farm Economy \nWith crop prices trending down and expenses holding firm, row crop farmers are facing shrinking, and often negative, profit margins. Strong yields are not enough to guarantee profitability when costs absorb so much of the limited revenue. \nAs such, profitability per acre is negative across most major crops: \nThese numbers underscore how the cost-price squeeze is leaving little room for farmers to cover debt obligations, reinvest in their operations or build reserves for future years. Programs like Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) provide stability when markets fall, and crop insurance helps farmers manage unpredictable weather and yield losses. However, they were not designed to weather persistent cost inflation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) makes meaningful progress by raising reference prices and expanding crop insurance options, steps that will provide stronger protection for row crop farmers once they take effect. These changes reflect the importance Congress placed on reinvesting in the safety net, and farmers are grateful for that commitment. The challenge is timing, as most of the improvements will not be in place until October 2026, leaving growers to navigate today’s tight margins without these tools. Ensuring a smooth transition until the new provisions begin will be key for helping farm families stay afloat and manage the years ahead. \nAbout the Farm Economy \nRow crop farmers are stuck in a cost-price squeeze that threatens profitability even in years of good harvests. Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton have all fallen from recent highs, while costs for seed, chemicals, energy, equipment, fertilizer, land, interest and labor remain stubbornly high. Many specialty crop growers also face similar headwinds, though limited public data make it harder to reveal per-acre profitability as easily. \nPast Market Intels highlight how these challenges connect: fertilizer, farm income, trade, and farm structure. Global competition, policy uncertainty and rising expenses keep pressure on the farm economy. \nAdditionally, farm financial stress is already showing up in the data through higher farm losses and more bankruptcy filings. While Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies remain below the long-term average, they have been creeping up as lower crop prices and elevated expenses eat into working capital. In 2024, over 200 farms filed for bankruptcies. However, many farms are not eligible to file for Chapter 12 bankruptcies. In fact, the U.S. has completely lost more than 140,000 farms from 2017 to 2022, and an additional 20,000 in the last two years. \nThe outlook depends on both market recovery and policy implementation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes important progress by raising reference prices and expanding crop insurance options, but most provisions do not take effect until late 2026. Until then, both row and specialty crop farmers must continue operating in an environment where global input costs remain high and crop returns are negative. Managing this gap will be critical to sustaining farm families and maintaining the resilience of U.S. agriculture. Until then, row crop farmers must continue operating in an environment where global input costs remain high and crop returns are negative. Managing this gap will be critical to sustaining farm families and maintaining the resilience of U.S. agriculture.

               "text": " LONDON (Reuters) -Britain’s motor finance industry is on the hook for 8.2 billion to 9.7 billion pounds ($11 billion-$13 billion) to compensate consumers for unfair car loans, the regulator said on Tuesday, in plans that point to a lower bill than the sector had feared. \nThe new estimates, outlined by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in a consultation, further cut forecasts of the hit to banks including Lloyds Banking Group, Close Brothers and Barclays. The estimates are based on either 85% or a ”very unlikely” 100% of eligibile consumers taking part in the planned scheme. \nThe FCA said consumers in Britain who fell victim to motor finance mis-selling between 2007 and 2024 could be eligible for around 700 pounds in compensation on average. \nLOWER THAN PREVIOUS COMPENSATION ESTIMATES \nThe regulator had previously estimated that a compensation scheme would cost between 9 billion and 18 billion pounds and that most individuals could receive less than 950 pounds in compensation. \nThat estimated bill had already calmed the industry’s worst fears that the costs of the saga could rival that of Britain’s payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which cost lenders more than 40 billion pounds between 2011 and 2019. \nEven with the lowered total bill, the scandal will still be one of the costliest for British banks. \nLenders, which also include the UK arms of Santander and Bank of Ireland and the lending arms of big automakers, have set aside more than 2 billion pounds between them to cover potential compensation claims. \nMany of the loans, which were packaged up by car dealers, stem from discretionary commission agreements (DCAs), in which lenders allowed car dealerships to earn higher fees by ramping up the interest rates consumers paid on the loans. \nThe FCA banned DCAs in 2021. \n($1 = 0.7440 pounds) \n(Reporting by Kirstin Ridley and Phoebe Seers; Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes) \nBy Kirstin Ridley and Phoebe Seers",

               "text": " NEW YORK, 7 octobre 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Zeta Network Group (Nasdaq : ZNB) (la « Société ») a annoncé aujourd’hui avoir conclu un accord de partenariat stratégique (l’« Accord ») avec SOLV Foundation (« SOLV »), une plateforme de financement structuré de qualité institutionnelle et de liquidités Bitcoin multi-chaînes, avec 2,5 milliards de dollars en valeur totale d’actifs numériques verrouillés (TVL), qui soutient SolvBTC sur les réseaux de chaînes de blocs Binance, Base et Solana. Ce partenariat souligne l’ambition de la Société de s’établir en tant que leader coté au Nasdaq dans le domaine du financement des actifs numériques basés sur le bitcoin. \nPrincipaux points de l’Accord \nL’Accord reflète la vision commune visant à positionner la Société comme une société financière centrée sur le bitcoin qui associe sa trésorerie en bitcoins à des stratégies innovantes en matière d’actifs numériques.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "OpenAI has acquired artificial intelligence (AI)-powered personal finance app Roi.\n\nThat’s according to an announcement from Roi co-founder/CEO Sujith Vishwajith last week in a post on social media platform X.\n\n“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience. Along the way we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance. It’s the future of software,” Vishwajith wrote.\n\n“This acquisition marks an incredible milestone for Roi, and we’re thrilled to continue building out our vision at OpenAI.”\n\nAccording to a report by TechCrunch, the word “we” here applies solely to the CEO, as sources tell that news outlet that he will be the only member of Roi’s four-person team moving over to OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Roi is set to wind down operations and end its service to clients on Oct. 15, the report added.\n\nIn other news from the intersection of AI and finance, PYMNTS wrote recently about the shift toward “cognitive banking,” which refers to embedding AI-driven inferencing and pattern recognition on top of permissioned data (transactions, financial behaviors, linked accounts), allowing banks to “shift from reactive servicing to proactive guidance.”\n\nInstead of waiting for customers to scroll through menus or submit queries, cognitive banking systems detect intent, flag opportunities, and offer “next-best actions” — whether that’s a liquidity suggestion, a personalized loan offer, or a fraud alert.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence has traced how AI in banking is shifting into its “next era,” where conversational interfaces move from simple Q&A bots to tools that can offer strategic insight and contextual counsel.\n\nImportantly, the research also shows that 75% of bank customers want more personalization and that embedded conversational AI could win back 72% of bank customers by giving them that tailored experience.\n\n“Thus, cognitive banking is not just about automation — it’s about personal relevance, timing and trust,” the report added.\n\nThe shift is already happening, PYMNTS said, with Bank of America recently debuting its AskGPS tool, which lets employees in the Global Payments Solutions unit pose simple to complex client questions and get authoritative answers in seconds.\n\n“This breaks from traditional knowledge bases — it’s not just ‘search’ but inference, context and response,” PYMNTS wrote.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.\n\nThe post OpenAI Buys Personal Finance App Roi appeared first on PYMNTS.com.",

               "text": " The New York City Department of Small Business Services (SBS) celebrated the conclusion of National Workforce Development Month with a graduation ceremony at LaGuardia Community College last week, welcoming the latest batch of healthcare finance and operations professionals. \nDozens of graduates from LaGuardia’s Healthcare Finance and Operations Training Program, which connects low-income New Yorkers with high-paying jobs in fast-growing industries such as healthcare, celebrated their graduation at LaGuardia Community College on Tuesday, Sept. 30. \nThe tuition-free program is designed for low-income New Yorkers with a high school diploma or equivalent and provides training in non-clinical positions within New York’s healthcare system. The six-month program prepares New Yorkers for entry-level roles in healthcare finance, such as revenue cycle and patient access coordination regardless of their economic background or education. \nThe recent class of graduates – Cohort 14 – represented the largest graduation class in the decade-long history of the program, with 97% of students successfully completely the most recent program. LaGuardia said it is currently finalizing job placements for the recent graduates. \nSBS said the recent graduation has come shortly after two significant agency milestones, with SBS connecting more than 81,000 New Yorkers to good-paying jobs since the beginning of the Adams Administration. SBS further stated that it has now served more than 250,000 New Yorkers through its 18 Workforce1 Career Centers since Mayor Eric Adams took office. \nSBS Commissioner Dynishal Gross said workforce training programs can simultaneously change students’ professional trajectories and meet the needs of employers across the city. \n“Health systems rely on quality operations, billing, nursing, and paraprofessional staff to function. These roles are not just critical to the industry – they also offer a solid career ladder and opportunity for growth for New Yorkers of all backgrounds,” Gross said in a statement welcoming the recent graduation ceremony. \nAdolfo Carrión Jr., the deputy mayor for Housing, Economic Development, and Workforce, described the healthcare industry as one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic industries in New York City. Carrión added that the Adams Administration has invested in the development healthcare support professionals because of that growth. \nMeanwhile, Sunil Gupta, Vice President of Adult Continuing Education and Workforce Development at LaGuardia, welcomed SBS’s partnership with the college and said the program continues to help low-income New Yorkers launch healthcare careers. \n“We are immensely grateful for SBS’s partnership, which allows us to offer training programs that help New Yorkers launch healthcare careers and fill critical skills gaps—both as frontline clinicians and essential behind-the-scenes professionals,” Gupta said in a statement. \nRecent cohorts of the Healthcare Finance and Operations Training Program have achievement job placement rates between 83% and 87%. \nIsaac Guzman, who graduated with Cohort 13 of the program, now works at Mount Sinai as a billing coordinator and payment poster. Guzman revealed that he plans to put the nine college credits he earned for completing the program toward a potential associate degree at LaGuardia. \n“I want to keep learning as much as I can,” Guzman said. “I would like to go back to school, at least part-time, to get certifications and any other degrees that would be useful, such as a bachelor’s in healthcare administration.”",
