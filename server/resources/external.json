            "text": " Israel’s Minister of Economy and Industry, Nir Barkat, will be leading the largest business delegation from the country to India next week to boost bilateral trade in what would be his third official visit to New Delhi. \nThe two-day visit starts next week on Monday. Barkat will also be meeting Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal during the trip. \n”The largest ever multi-sectoral CEO level delegation from Israel comprises over 100 innovative Israeli companies from healthcare, energy, cybersecurity, defence and HLS, agritech, smart mobility, watertech, foodTech, and more,” officials told PTI. \nThe high-profile visit is being coordinated by the Ministry of Economy & Industry on the Israeli side and the Ministry of Commerce & Industry on the Indian side. \nIt will involve the participation of all the major chambers from Israel - the Israel Export Institute, Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce and The Manufacturers Association of Israel, while FICCI and CII will be taking the lead from the Indian side. \nThe two-day programme includes a business forum, B2B meetings with Indian companies, the interaction of a restricted CEOs Forum nominated by the two governments, a session by Invest India (under DPIIT); roundtables and industry visits. \nThe Israeli delegation will also be participating in the India Energy Week being organised at the same time in Delhi. \nWith ceasefire agreements holding up so far in the north and south of Israel, Israeli businessmen have expressed hopes that the resumption of Air India flights from March 2 and relative calm in the region will help boost bilateral trade between India and Israel. \nBarkat during his visit to India in April 2023, even before the war broke out in October of that year, had expressed interest in bringing skilled labour from India in various sectors to fill in the massive shortage of workers in Israel. \nWith the shortage of workers becoming even more acute during the war that started with Islamist Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Israel has brought in about 13,000 workers from India in the construction sector and is working on bringing several thousand more, also in other sectors of the economy. \nMuch of bilateral trade between India and Israel had been traditionally dependent on transactions in diamonds since diplomatic relations were established in 1992, but of late it has diversified and six clusters have been identified as areas of focus - Advanced Manufacturing; Climate & Desert Tech, Agro & Food tech; Defence & HLS; High Tech and Life Science & Health.",

While many of these professionals have worked for years and may even have degrees in finance , every finance expert had to start somewhere.\nFind Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here’s How I Use ChatGPT To Make a Lot of Money\nRead Next: 5 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nWhile it’s never a bad idea to start from the ground up in an industry you hope to maintain a career in, some first jobs can offer skills that parlay themselves into finance jobs down the road.\nThe skills necessary to enter finance jobs vary beyond just being good with numbers. They include:\nCommunication and interpersonal skills\nProject management skills\nUtilization of digital tools\nWhen you look at finance as a series of acquired skills, you can see how those skills apply to a variety of other jobs which, while they may not be in finance, can prepare or connect you for finance jobs.\nCheck Out: I Made $10,000 Using One of Dave Ramsey’s Best Passive Income Ideas\nSales\nWhether you’re hawking perfume at a local mall, selling ads for a newspaper or any other career in between, sales jobs can set you up for a career in finance, according to Joe Camberato, CEO at NationalBusinessCapital.com .\nHe pointed out that finance has a ton of different career paths, and “where you start should depend on where you ultimately want to end up.”\nFor people interested in being on “the deal-making side of things,” he suggested starting in sales — whether it’s finance-related or not.\n“Selling anything teaches you the three core skills you need to close deals: communication, negotiation and handling rejection. Those are the great pillars of success for closing deals, so master them.”\nRetail Clerk\nAnyone who has ever worked retail knows that these jobs require a variety of skills, from problem-solving to communication, and often doing so under pressure. You might have to deal with inventory, point-of-sale machines, and most likely numbers. Many retail jobs require a lot more than just scanning items at the cash register. Retail sales clerks can learn many of the skills that will end up being useful in a finance career.\nBank Teller\nWhat better way to dip a toe into the world of finance than training to become a bank teller. These jobs typically don’t require more than a high school diploma and will offer on-the-job training. Bank tellers learn such skills as how to balance cash drawers, utilize financial software, and explain or interact with a variety of customer services, as well as communication skills. You’re also likely to be in contact with financial professionals, and it will be a great resume builder for a future finance job.\nStory Continues\nReceptionist\nIn almost every brick and mortar place of employment, particularly public-facing ones, you’ll find the need for a receptionist. These jobs can include tasks such as answering phones, scheduling appointments, greeting customers and showing them to a particular destination. It can include copying, filing, email and other daily tasks that lay a foundation for more complicated tasks of a similar nature that finance jobs may require. In fact, a savvy young employee might seek out such jobs at places like financial planning or accounting offices to get access to finance professionals while working their way up.\nInformation Clerks\nInformation clerks are people who help answer questions for others in a number of different settings. Their tasks can include such things as preparing reports or claims, collecting and recording data, answering questions from customers or the general public, filing and maintaining records and a bunch of other tasks. You can find these jobs in a variety of areas, such as businesses, courts, human resources departments, doctor’s offices, hotels and resorts, and even airports and libraries. These jobs teach you to be resourceful, dig up data, draw conclusions and analyze information, as well as often interact with people.\nInternships\nSometimes the best way into finance is to look for internships — some of which may be paid, while others just give you experience or important connections, according to Forrest Webber, an analyst for Plastic Fusion , a sustainable environmental containment company.\nWebber interned at JPMorgan while in college and was offered a job through the Global Finance and Business Management Analyst program.\n“This program is an excellent way to break into finance and with paths to work your way up to a hedge fund manager,” he explained. The two-year program is designed to provide broad business and cross-functional exposure.\nMore From GOBankingRates",

            "text": "Uganda court charges senior finance officials with corruption over central bank hacking\nSusmita Chaulagain | Kathmandu School of Law, NP\nFebruary 9, 2025 10:32:24 am\nA Ugandan court on Wednesday charged nine senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development over their alleged involvement in corruption, electronic fraud, and money laundering in connection with a hacking incident that led to a financial loss of at least $21 million from the country’s central bank.\nThe hacking occurred last year and involved redirecting some payments from its intended beneficiary to different recipients, according to the charges read in a magistrate’s court in the capital Kampala. Last November, State Minister for Finance Henry Musasizi confirmed the hacking of the central bank’s account and the Bank of Uganda said it was awaiting a police investigation into a news report that offshore hackers stole 62 billion Ugandan shillings ($16.8 million) from the central bank. Uganda’s police had detained finance ministry officials on February 5  as part of an investigation into accusations of hacking.\nThe chargesheet filed in magistrate court has a total of 11 charges against the accused out of which 5 charges are of corruption, two charges of financial loss, one for abuse of office, two for electronic fraud, and one for money laundering. All these charges were charges under the Anti-Corruption Act and The Computer Misuse Act.\nAccording to the charge sheet funds intended for the International Development Association (IDA), a World Bank affiliate, as repayments for Uganda’s loans were illegally redirected to companies in Japan, Poland, and the UK. Court documents show that a $6.134 million debt servicing repayment to the World Bank was instead sent to Road Way Company in Japan, with the money landing in an account at MFUFG Bank on November 12 and $8.569 million intended for the African Development Bank was paid to NJS International in London on September 28.\nThe accused were the Accountant General in the Ministry of Finance, Lawrence Semakula, the acting director of Treasury Services and Asset Management, Jennifer Muhuruzi, a senior IT officer, Tonny Yawe, a systems IT officer, Paul Nkalubo Lumala, a senior accountant in the Treasury Services Department, Deborah Dorothy Kusiima, an accountant, Judith Ashaba, a research assistant, Bettina Nayebare, and an IT systems officer,  Mark Kasiiku. The court has issued criminal summonses against  Pedson Twesigomwe, the assistant commissioner after she failed to turn up in court. The group was not allowed to take a plea to the charge of money laundering as it is only triable by the High Court .\nLawyer Max Mutabingwa, who represented one of the suspects, attempted to apply for bail, but the suspects were denied bail and remanded in custody until February 18, when their case will be mentioned in the high court. Due to the severity of the offenses, which are only triable in the high court, they were not allowed to enter a plea.  Authorities will continue to investigate the full extent of the breach and whether additional individuals were involved in the fraud.\nGET OUR DAILY DIGEST",

            "text": "Squawk Box Asia\nGlobal tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump aside, New Zealand is optimistic about its trade relationship with the United States.\nSpeaking to CNBC’s ” Squawk Box Asia ,” New Zealand Finance Minister Nicola Willis said that ”New Zealand is distinguished in that we have a very balanced and complementary trade relationship with the United States,” adding that it’s ”hopeful of pursuing ongoing positive trade relationships” with it.\nShe noted that the U.S. imports meat and wine from the country, and New Zealand imports ”significant goods and services from the United States.”\nTrump on Sunday said he will announce global tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S, adding on to earlier threats of tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\nAccording to New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the country exported 14.6 billion New Zealand dollars ($8.26 billion) in goods and services to the United States — overtaking Australia to become New Zealand’s second-largest export market — and imported NZ$11.4 billion for the 12 months ending March 2024.\nThat represented a trade balance of NZ$3.5 billion and a total trade value of NZ$25.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation.\nWillis described the relationship between the two nations as ”one that works for both parties,” pointing out that New Zealand is also part of the ”Five Eyes” intelligence alliance, which she said is ”a foundation of a very strong strategic relationship.”\nThe ”Five Eyes” is an intelligence alliance comprising Canada, the United States, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand.\nWhen asked if that means the country will be able to avoid tariffs from Trump, Willis said that ”decisions on tariffs are matters for the U.S. administration,” and New Zealand ”would deal” with the situation if it arises.\nShe is of the view that the New Zealand dollar will provide some buffers if tariffs are implemented, saying that a lower New Zealand dollar will assist the country’s exporters by making exports more competitive.\nThe kiwi recently weakened to its lowest point in over two years against the U.S. dollar, trading at 0.5515 to the greenback on Feb. 3.\nWillis also acknowledged the country’s ”significant current account deficit,” but added that the flexibility of the exchange rate will ”allow balancing to occur.”\nStock Chart Icon",

            "site_type": "news",
            "text": "Dave Benett/Getty ImagesQueen Camilla’s son Tom Parker Bowles is giving royal fans some insight into his humble upbringing.\n\n“I haven’t flown with my mother for years, but when my sister and I were young it was always British Airways in economy,” Bowles, 50, said in an interview with The Sunday Times published on Sunday, February 9. “I love BA staff, they’re the best in the world, and I love Terminal 5. But the BA product will never catch up with Singapore, Qatar and Emirates.”\n\nParker Bowles added that his mother “loves traveling” though she doesn’t get to do it as much as she once did as she is mostly “based in the UK nowadays.”\n\nThe family spent a lot of time on ski holidays in the winter, he also said, though Queen Camilla “hated skiing, though, so she’d send us up the mountain with a guide while she sat and read her book.” They often traveled to Italy with his grandparents, where Parker Bowles developed a fondness for older-style hotels.\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images“Great hotels are an art form. I hate those hotels where they charge you for internet and water and it’s impossible to turn off the lights,” he shared.\n\nAs for travel activities, Parker Bowles added that his mother “loves walking and I love walking, so we just wander off together.”\n\n“She hasn’t changed at all over the years: if you give her the sun and a book, she’s perfectly happy,” he explained. “The King loves walking too, but he’s the most hard-working man I’ve ever met. I don’t think he’s the sort of person who can just flop onto a deck chair and disappear into a book.”\n\nQueen Camilla wasn’t terribly interested in ascending the throne, author Tom Quinn wrote in his new book, Yes Ma’am: the Secret Life of Royal Servants, which was published Thursday, February 6.\n\nTHANK YOU!\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: TOM PARKER BOWLES REVEALS HIS KIDS’ SWEET NICKNAME FOR KING CHARLES III\n\n\n\nQueen Camilla’s son, Tom Parker Bowles, revealed the sweet nickname his children have for their step-grandfather, King Charles III. Parker Bowles, 49, appeared on the Sunday, October 13, episode of Love Your Weekend with Alan Titchmarsh, where he revealed the affectionate name his two kids — daughter Lola, 17, and son Freddy, 14 — have […]\n\n“One member of staff told me that at one point, Camilla hated the idea of being queen and would regularly say to Charles, ‘Can’t we get away from all this protocol? It’s all bollocks,” he explained.\n\n“Charles, who hates swearing, would demurely reply, ‘You’re doing it [becoming queen] for me, darling,” Quinn added in the book.\n\nQuinn also added that both the King and his son Prince William are “prone to tantrums” if protocol isn’t carried out the way they prefer. “They both get irritated very quickly,” a former member of the royal staff told the author. “They are very picky. It comes naturally to them.”\n\n\n\nCheckout latest world news below links :\nWorld News || Latest News || U.S. News\n\nSource link\n\nThe post Queen Camilla’s Son Tom Parker Bowles Says They ‘Always’ Flew Economy appeared first on WorldNewsEra.",

            "text": "Guy Hedgecoe\n\nBusiness reporter\n\nReporting fromSegovia, central SpainGetty ImagesSpain attracts the second highest number of overseas visitors after France\n\nIt’s a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city’s Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.\n\nMany of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia’s historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.\n\n“There was a moment during Covid when I thought ‘maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before’,” says Elena Mirón, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.\n\n“But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I’m happy, because I can live off this job I love.”\n\nTour guide Elena Mirón is upbeat about the strength of the Spanish economy\n\nSpain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world’s biggest foreign tourist hub.\n\nAnd the tourism industry’s post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.\n\nBy contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.\n\nThis all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world’s best-performing economy.\n\n“The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,” says Carlos Cuerpo, the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.\n\nAlthough he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.\n\n“We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,” he adds.\n\nCarlos Cuerpo focuses on the country’s economy being well=balanced\n\nThat modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU’s Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to €163bn by 2026 ($169bn; £136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.\n\nSpain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.\n\n“Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,” says María Jesús Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain’s IESE Business School.\n\nOther major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, “is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism”.\n\nSince Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.\n\nMadrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.\n\nAt the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called “Iberian exception”, allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers’ bills.\n\nMr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain’s traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.\n\n“Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks – including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,” he said. “And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.”\n\n\n\nThe country’s green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.\n\nThe latter is a boon for a country that is Europe’s second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.\n\n“[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,” he says. “There’s no point in making zero-emission cars if you’re using dirty energy.”\n\nDespite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain’s economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block’s average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.\n\nThis reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts. It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.\n\nAlso, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.\n\nThe Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as “fundamental”.\n\nThe European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc’s big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.\n\nGetty ImagesProtests against tourist numbers have taken place from the Canary Islands to Majorca\n\nThe heavy reliance on tourism – and a growing backlash against the industry by local people – is one concern.\n\nAnother is Spain’s vast public debt, which is higher than the country’s annual economic output.\n\nMaría Jesús Valdemoros warns that this is “an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU’s new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability”.\n\nIn addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.\n\nWith an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for Sánchez’s minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.\n\nRead more global business and tech storiesCheckout latest world news below links :\nWorld News || Latest News || U.S. News\n\nSource link\n\nThe post How Spain’s economy became the envy of Europe appeared first on WorldNewsEra.",

            "text": "In her book ‘Break your Budget’, Michela Alloca details where the small expenses are that are wasting your money and how you can save. Related stories AS USA \nAS USA \nAmerican financial expert Michela Allocca is clear about what you should always do to maintain healthy finances in 2025—whether it feels lazy or requires effort. It all starts with small habits, such as returning items you don’t truly want, avoiding unnecessary sale purchases, and carefully tracking your expenses to understand why you’re not saving. \nOne of her key principles is returning things that don’t convince you, even if it requires extra effort. “If I order clothes online and try them on but don’t feel absolutely thrilled or eager to wear them outside, I return them,” she explains. \n“I don’t care if I have to find a place to print a label. I don’t care if I have to walk or drive to a UPS or FedEx store. I don’t care if it costs me a five-dollar restocking fee—I’m returning those things.” She’s also firm on the consequences of keeping unnecessary items: “Saving things you don’t like or won’t use is basically like flushing money down the toilet.” \nAllocca also advises against using traditional savings accounts, emphasizing the benefits of high-yield savings accounts instead. According to her, traditional savings accounts linked to checking accounts are a “total waste of space” due to their minuscule interest rates—often as low as 0.1%—while a high-yield account can offer at least 3.5%, as long as it’s insured. \nHow to save money in 2025: explained \nAlong those lines, she recommends avoiding debit cards altogether. Instead, she puts all her spending on credit cards, using them strategically to ensure she only spends what she has, avoiding day-to-day debt. \nShe also warns against shopping sales just for the sake of it. “I don’t shop on sale—and that doesn’t mean I never buy discounted items,” she clarifies. “If you buy something on sale that you don’t actually need, you’re not saving money—you’re just spending it.” \nFinally, she highlights the importance of tracking expenses, even though it can be uncomfortable. Writing down where your money goes—fixed expenses, incidental costs, food, gas, transportation, clothing, bills, and extras like insurance or birthday parties—can feel overwhelming, but seeing it laid out in a table helps identify not just small, everyday expenses but also larger patterns. This awareness allows for better financial planning based on your salary and income. \nFollow the Diario AS channel on WhatsApp, where you will find all the sport in one place: the current news of the day, the agenda with the latest news on the most important sporting events, the most outstanding images, the opinion of the best AS writers, reports, videos, and some humour from time to time. \n1",

            "site_type": "news",
            "text": "How Lenders and Brokers manipulated car finance deals for higher profits?\nDate:\nFebruary 10, 2025\nFor years, lenders and brokers in the UK have used opaque pricing structures to maximise their profits. Many consumers unknowingly paid excessive interest rates due to discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs). This unfair practice allowed brokers to increase interest rates and pocket higher commissions.\nThe Discretionary Commission Model: A System Stacked Against Borrowers\nCar finance brokers often had the power to adjust interest rates within set limits. The higher the rate, the more commission they earned, creating a clear conflict of interest. This system incentivised brokers to overcharge customers, maximising their own profits while increasing borrower costs.\nA 2021 investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that customers lost an estimated £300 million per year due to these inflated charges. Lenders justified this by arguing that brokers needed flexibility in pricing. In reality, this flexibility disproportionately favoured brokers at the expense of ordinary drivers.\nHow Lenders and Brokers Worked Together to Maximise Profits?\nBrokers received commission structures designed to encourage high-interest deals. This was not disclosed clearly to consumers, leaving them unaware of cheaper alternatives. Customers who trusted dealerships or brokers unknowingly signed agreements with excessive costs.\nLenders approved these arrangements because they benefited from the increased interest payments. Instead of offering fair deals, they enabled brokers to manipulate rates for greater financial returns. The FCA later identified that many agreements resulted in borrowers paying thousands more than necessary over the loan term.\nThe FCA Crackdown: Ending Unfair Commission Models\nIn 2021, the FCA banned discretionary commission arrangements, preventing brokers from inflating interest rates for commission. This move aimed to make car finance pricing fairer and more transparent. Borrowers would now receive standardised rates without broker interference.\nThis decision followed mounting evidence of widespread exploitation in the motor finance sector. The FCA’s findings led to increased regulatory scrutiny, forcing lenders to revise their commission structures. As a result, car finance deals became more consumer-friendly, saving drivers significant amounts.\nWere You Overcharged? Check Your PCP Claim\nMillions of car finance customers could have overpaid due to manipulated interest rates. If you took out a finance agreement before January 2021, you might have been affected. Checking your loan documents can help determine whether you were charged unfairly.\nIf you financed your car through Personal Contract Purchase (PCP), you should consider using a PCP claims checker to see if you’re owed compensation. Many customers unknowingly agreed to inflated interest rates, leading to excessive monthly payments. A claims checker can help you determine whether you qualify for a refund and guide you on the next steps.\nSeveral claims management firms now assist consumers in reclaiming overpaid interest. The FCA’s guidance encourages affected customers to seek refunds, although the process varies by lender. If you believe you were overcharged, contacting your lender directly or consulting a financial expert is advisable.\nThe Future of Car Finance: What’s Changing?\nLenders now operate under stricter FCA guidelines, reducing the likelihood of similar manipulation. Interest rates are more transparent, and brokers no longer have control over pricing structures. Borrowers can expect fairer deals, but staying informed remains crucial.\nFuture regulatory changes may further improve consumer protection in car finance agreements. As lenders adapt, customers should compare finance offers carefully to avoid excessive costs. Understanding your rights ensures that you secure the best possible deal when financing a vehicle.",

            "site_type": "news",
            "text": " Dublin, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ”Strategic Insights into the EV Manufacturing Ecosystem OEM Strategies, Advancements in Automation and AI Integration, and Circular Economy Principles - Global Forecast to 2035” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering. \nThe Electric Vehicle market size is projected to grow from 15.70 million units in 2024 to 46.31 million units by 2035, at a CAGR of 10.3%. \nThe future of EV manufacturers will be shaped by a shift to modular and scalable assembly platforms that enable faster production and customization. Tesla is developing an electric car platform called NV9X for their next-generation vehicle, codenamed Redwood, which will use this architecture internally. \nFurther, Automation and artificial intelligence-driven manufacturing processes will dominate, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Manufacturers will increasingly integrate circular economy practices, emphasizing battery recycling and sustainable materials. Collaboration with battery manufacturers will be key, especially for the advancement of solid-state and sodium-ion batteries. In addition, EV manufacturers will focus on affordable models to achieve mass adoption, alongside premium offerings with advanced connectivity and autonomous driving capabilities. \nPassenger cars segment is estimated to hold the largest market share during the forecast period. \nThe passenger car segment dominates market share in China thanks to a combination of government incentives, strict emissions regulations and growing consumer preference for electric vehicles. The Chinese government has heavily subsidized EV adoption through tax exemptions, purchase incentives and infrastructure investment, making EVs more affordable. Further, rising awareness of environmental issues and advances in battery technology have made electric vehicle increasingly attractive to consumers. To capitalize on this trend, Chinese OEMs such as BYD, NIO, Geely and SAIC are ramping up EV production with ambitious initiatives. \nThese include developing advanced battery technologies such as solid-state and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, expanding global footprints and investing in smart manufacturing facilities. Companies are also looking to integrate software such as autonomous driving and connected car technology to differentiate themselves in the competitive electric vehicle market. Additionally, partnerships with global and domestic suppliers to secure raw materials such as lithium and cobalt underline their commitment to a sustainable supply chain. Looking ahead, Chinese OEMs are striving to lead the global EV market by introducing innovative models, expanding production capacity, and meeting the growing demand for affordable and premium EVs at domestically and internationally. \nDevelopment in EV platformization and platform sharing boosting the EV manufacturing process \nPlatformization and platform sharing have emerged as important techniques for electric vehicle manufacturers to acquire scalability, cost performance, and faster time-to-market. By developing modular and bendy EV architectures, inclusive of Volkswagen’s MEB platform, Hyundai’s E-GMP, and Renault’s CMF-EV, automakers can standardize components throughout multiple models and brands, decreasing production complexity and achieving economies of scale. Hyundai and Kia’s internal platform-sharing strategy maximizes economies of scale across segments, from mainstream to luxury vehicles. The Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) underpins models like Hyundai Ioniq 5/6/7, Kia EV6, and Genesis GV60. \nFurther, These systems assist various automobile types, together with sedans, SUVs, and even business vehicles, enabling producers to cater to diverse market segments with minimum layout modifications. In May 2024, SAIC Motor and Audi officially signed a cooperation agreement to jointly expand the Advanced Digitized Platform, following a memorandum of information signed in July 2023. This trend not only lowers production costs but also facilitates advancements in battery technology, software integration, and autonomous driving systems, as shared platforms provide a consistent foundation for implementing new features across a wider vehicle lineup. As an end result, platform sharing is poised to accelerate the transition to electrification at the same time as improving profitability and sustainability for producers globally. \nEurope is anticipated to be one of the fastest markets over the forecast period. \nEurope is poised to be one of the fastest-growing market for electric vehicle manufacturing, driven by ambitious climate policies, significant government incentives, and stringent emissions regulations.

            "text": "Global tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump aside, New Zealand is optimistic about its trade relationship with the United States.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia,” New Zealand Finance Minister Nicola Willis said that “New Zealand is distinguished in that we have a very balanced and complementary trade relationship with the United States,” adding that it’s “hopeful of pursuing ongoing positive trade relationships” with it.\n\nShe noted that the U.S. imports meat and wine from the country, and New Zealand imports “significant goods and services from the United States.”\n\nTrump on Sunday said he will announce global tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports into the U.S, adding on to earlier threats of tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nAccording to New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the country exported 14.6 billion New Zealand dollars ($8.26 billion) in goods and services to the United States — overtaking Australia to become New Zealand’s second-largest export market — and imported NZ$11.4 billion for the 12 months ending March 2024.\n\nThat represented a trade balance of NZ$3.5 billion and a total trade value of NZ$25.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nWillis described the relationship between the two nations as “one that works for both parties,” pointing out that New Zealand is also part of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance, which she said is “a foundation of a very strong strategic relationship.”\n\nThe “Five Eyes” is an intelligence alliance comprising Canada, the United States, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWhen asked if that means the country will be able to avoid tariffs from Trump, Willis said that “decisions on tariffs are matters for the U.S. administration,” and New Zealand “would deal” with the situation if it arises.\n\nShe is of the view that the New Zealand dollar will provide some buffers if tariffs are implemented, saying that a lower New Zealand dollar will assist the country’s exporters by making exports more competitive.\n\nThe kiwi recently weakened to its lowest point in over two years against the U.S. dollar, trading at 0.5515 to the greenback on Feb. 3.\n\nWillis also acknowledged the country’s “significant current account deficit,” but added that the flexibility of the exchange rate will “allow balancing to occur.”\n\nStock Chart IconStock chart icon\n\n\n\nCheckout latest world news below links :\nWorld News || Latest News || U.S. News\n\nSource link\n\nThe post New Zealand has ‘complementary’ trade ties with the U.S., finance minister says, as Trump tariff threat looms appeared first on WorldNewsEra.",

Turns out, we added 100,000 more jobs in November and December than we originally thought.\n\nRevisions are normal, but economist Cory Stahle with Indeed.com said there’s another reason this one was so big.\n\n“Revisions tend to be more common when there are shocks or kind of climate disruptions that impact the data collection,” he said.\n\nHurricane Milton devastated the Gulf Coast in October of last year. “And as a result, you know, the jobs numbers were hit there. But also I would imagine some of the reporting in the following months was also impacted, as well,” Stahle said.\n\nSo it sounds like good news — there are 100,000 more jobs added than previously thought.\n\nBut “I’m not seeing at the macro level, things to suggest that the labor market is accelerating,” said Pavlina Tcherneva, president of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College.\n\nShe isn’t ready to call it a turnaround. “We knew that the labor market was slowing down, and so a couple of months of positive news doesn’t seem to show a turnaround in trend.”\n\nTcherneva said long-term trends still tell the same story. The percentage of people in the labor force has been stagnant in 2024, and in the past two years, the number of people staying unemployed for at least six months has gone up.",

But for many it comes with a nice bonus at the end: that great tax refund .\nWhile that refund may sound great — and there are many useful things to do with it — the reason for the money may not make everyone smile. The refund comes because someone overpaid the government.\nRead Next: 6 Reasons Your Tax Refund Will Be Higher in 2025\nFind Out: 3 Sneaky Things You Didn’t Realize Your Tax Software Was Doing — And How to Stop Them This Year\nIf you’d like to keep more of your money to have throughout the year, rather than counting on the tax refund to help shape up your finances , here are some steps you can take that may help your budget all year long.\nConsider Your Options\nFirst, you’re certainly in good company if you receive a tax refund each year. It’s likely most of the people you know are among the millions who typically receive a refund from their taxes.\nBut what would happen if you changed your withholding status for taxes? You might have an extra $247 each month if you balanced it out so you didn’t owe and you weren’t waiting for a refund, according to TurboTax .\nDiscover More: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth\nComplete a New W-4 Form\nIf you’ve decided you want to recalculate your tax withholding so you don’t get a refund but also don’t need to pay anything additional, some simple steps can go a long way.\nThe first step is to fill out a new W-4 form. That’s the paperwork you filled out with an employer so they know how much to take out for taxes. You may not realize a new version of the form was put out in 2020.\nYou could take the time to fill out a new form and adjust how much is taken out from each of your paychecks, per Ramsey Solutions .\nDo the Math\nAnother step you’ll need to take is figuring out how to fill out the W-4 so you don’t need to count on a refund ever again.\nOne way to do this is to take the refund amount you received in the last tax year and divide it by how many paychecks you receive. You can then do the math and adjust your paychecks and taxes accordingly.\nYou have some other options, as well. You could use an online tax calculator. Additionally, a tax professional may be able to help.\nPlan Your Budget\nIf you are looking to plan your overall finances so you never need to count on a refund, that means some more work than simply filling out another W-4. You also need to figure out how to plan the budget based on what you’ll receive from each paycheck under the new withholding calculations .\nStory Continues\nIf you’re used to using your refund to help your overall finances, you could consider doing the same thing with the extra amount you might have each month from adjusting how much is withheld. Per Fidelity , you could look at investment opportunities or put the money aside for emergencies.\nMore From GOBankingRates",

            "site_type": "news",
            "text": "Key Points\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the U.S. Treasury to stop minting pennies.\nThat came after Elon Musk and DOGE made the coin a focus of negative attention for wasteful spending.\nThere are currently 114 billion pennies in circulation, or $1.14 billion, or 0.006% of U.S. money, and economists say the impact should be minimal, but not wholly without potential inflationary and pricing changes.\nPennies are displayed at Glenview Coin & Collectibles July 6, 2006 in Glenview, Illinois. \nTim Boyle | Getty Images News | Getty Images\nTalk to end the penny’s production has been bandied about for decades among government officials and economists. However, the talk became policy when, over the weekend, President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury to stop minting new pennies .\n”For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote in a post Sunday night on his Truth Social site. ”I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.”\nTrump’s attack on the penny came after Elon Musk’s DOGE already had targeted the coin for elimination. Among all the contentious battles that the Trump administration and Musk find themselves in over government spending, this is one that most economists and others in the monetary ecosystem seem nonplussed about.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, there are 114 billion pennies in circulation, or $1.14 billion, or 0.006% of the money in circulation. It costs $192 million a year to produce pennies, about 4% of the Mint’s operating budget but only 0.00003% of the U.S. federal budget. This expense makes the penny expendable, according to economists.\nDavid Gulley, an economics professor at Bentley University, said the estimated cost of making a penny, at around three cents, is an economic burden, ”because millions vanish under couch cushions each year, the U.S. Mint must produce a steady stream of replacements.”\nRounding up prices\nBut banishing the penny could alter the prices of many small-ticket goods.\n”Prices would have to be rounded to the nearest five cents to allow for cash payments and correct change received back — that will be the end of $6.99 fast food combo meals,” Gulley said, adding that it’s not clear if businesses would tend to round up or down.\nThat pricing decision does matter, with some citing the penny’s impact on inflation, but even that appears minimal.\n”Businesses might round up more often than down, leading to a slight inflationary effect,” said David Smith, an economics professor at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio Business School. But he added that studies have shown that rounding prices to the nearest nickel does not lead to significant inflation. \nIn Canada, which eliminated the penny in 2013, cash transactions were rounded to the nearest five cents, based on the total amount of the transaction, not on each individual item.\nTo the extent rounding up occurs more frequently than rounding down, cash consumers would be paying the price for the cost efficiency Trump and Musk are seeking, said Ajay Patel, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University School of Business.\nAmerica’s remaining cash consumers get hit\nThere are still people who use cash for many payments, and these consumers would be the most impacted, but the effect would be modest, according to Gulley, as more payments move away from physical currency. As recently as 2015, one-third of transactions in the U.S. were by cash, but that has now fallen to under 20%, and it is expected to continue on the decline.\nBut that means people at the bottom of the economic ladder will probably feel the penny pinch the most.\n”The individuals paying for this benefit will be those who purchase products and services using cash and will continue to do so going forward because they are either unbanked or unable to access debit or credit cards or a digital wallet,” Patel said.\nGates Little, the CEO of Alabama-based Southern Bank, said the financial services sector won’t miss the pennies.\n”Eliminating the U.S. penny wouldn’t make any difference in the economy,” Little said. ”I can’t think of how it could hurt.”  \nYour saved penny may increase in value\nStill, Little said, the gazillion pennies hoarded in piggy banks, sock drawers, and hiding under your car seats would gradually increase in value.\n”Pennies would become more scarce over time and eventually increase in value. In the near term, they might become useless, depending on how the Treasury treats them. I would think that would have to be in phases so people could convert them to other denominations, thus removing them from the system,” Little said.\nThere are pockets of population around the country where both of these outcomes matter. Laura Maike, of Burton, Ohio, notes that the Amish will feel the pinch right now.\n”Here in Northeast Ohio’s Amish country, we still use pennies regularly,” Maike said of her area, which includes thousands of generally cash-using Amish. ”How would this work for cash-only transactions? It would be impossible to give exact change as the purchaser or seller.” \nMaike is more bullish, though, on a world in which the end of the penny means existing pennies increase in value.\n”I have a wheat penny sitting in my jewelry box because I knew when I found it nearly 20 years ago that they were becoming increasingly harder to find,” Maike said.\nPennies depicting two sheaves of wheat were discontinued in favor of today’s Lincoln versions in 1958.\nSmith said there are other benefits to getting rid of the heavy-to-transport pennies.\n”Eliminating the penny would save taxpayers millions of dollars each year. In addition, the production of pennies has environmental costs, including the mining of zinc and copper, eliminating the penny could have a positive environmental impact,” he said.\nSome Americans are reacting to the end of the penny with a sense of humor. ”How will people give their two cents?” said Eileen Kailholz, a retiree in Bright, Indiana.\nBut it’s not entirely a joking matter. Nate Throckmorton, an associate professor of economics at William & Mary, says it may be time to start keep an eye on another coin in your piggy bank: the nickel.\n”It’s the nickel we should worry about,” Throckmorton said.\nIt takes three cents to make a penny, but 11 cents to make a nickel.\nwatch now",

            "site_type": "news",
            "text": "Talk to end the penny’s production has been bandied about for decades among government officials and economists. However, the talk became policy when, over the weekend, President Donald Trump ordered the Treasury to stop minting new pennies.\n\n“For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!” Trump wrote in a post Sunday night on his Truth Social site. “I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.”\n\nTrump’s attack on the penny came after Elon Musk’s DOGE already had targeted the coin for elimination. Among all the contentious battles that the Trump administration and Musk find themselves in over government spending, this is one that most economists and others in the monetary ecosystem seem nonplussed about.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve, there are 114 billion pennies in circulation, or $1.14 billion, or 0.006% of the money in circulation. It costs $192 million a year to produce pennies, about 4% of the Mint’s operating budget but only 0.00003% of the U.S. federal budget. This expense makes the penny expendable, according to economists.\n\nDavid Gulley, an economics professor at Bentley University, said the estimated cost of making a penny, at around three cents, is an economic burden, “because millions vanish under couch cushions each year, the U.S. Mint must produce a steady stream of replacements.”\n\nROUNDING UP PRICES\nBut banishing the penny could alter the prices of many small-ticket goods.\n\n“Prices would have to be rounded to the nearest five cents to allow for cash payments and correct change received back — that will be the end of $6.99 fast food combo meals,” Gulley said, adding that it’s not clear if businesses would tend to round up or down.\n\nThat pricing decision does matter, with some citing the penny’s impact on inflation, but even that appears minimal.\n\n“Businesses might round up more often than down, leading to a slight inflationary effect,” said David Smith, an economics professor at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio Business School. But he added that studies have shown that rounding prices to the nearest nickel does not lead to significant inflation.\n\nIn Canada, which eliminated the penny in 2013, cash transactions were rounded to the nearest five cents, based on the total amount of the transaction, not on each individual item.\n\nTo the extent rounding up occurs more frequently than rounding down, cash consumers would be paying the price for the cost efficiency Trump and Musk are seeking, said Ajay Patel, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University School of Business.\n\nCanada’s experience in eliminating the penny shows there are some additional costs for consumers to bear. A 2017 paper by Canadian economist Christina Cheung found that penny-rounding in grocery transactions imposed a “rounding tax” of approximately $3.27 million, from Canadian consumers to grocery vendors. For a typical grocery store, though, this amounted to an estimated additional revenue of $157, indicating a minimal impact on individual consumers.\n\nAMERICA’S REMAINING CASH CONSUMERS GET HIT\nPatel points out that eliminating the penny would only eliminate the penny itself, not necessarily something that costs $5.16. “Anyone writing a check or using a debit card or credit card could have the correct amount paid since no actual cash changes hands, and pennies would not have to be paid by the buyer or returned by the seller,” he said.\n\nThere are still people who use cash for many payments, and these consumers would be the most impacted, but the effect would be modest, according to Gulley, as more payments move away from physical currency. As recently as 2015, one-third of transactions in the U.S. were by cash, but that has now fallen to under 20%, and it is expected to continue on the decline.\n\nBut that means people at the bottom of the economic ladder will probably feel any penny pinch the most.\n\n“The individuals paying for this benefit will be those who purchase products and services using cash and will continue to do so going forward because they are either unbanked or unable to access debit or credit cards or a digital wallet,” Patel said.\n\nGates Little, the CEO of Alabama-based Southern Bank, said the financial services sector won’t miss the pennies.\n\n“Eliminating the U.S. penny wouldn’t make any difference in the economy,” Little said. “I can’t think of how it could hurt.”\n\nPatel noted that President Trump only ordered the cessation of minting new pennies, not their purge from use in the currency system. So people can continue using pennies until they are slowly reabsorbed into the banking system and are eventually melted down to recycle their zinc and copper. Patel says the actual elimination of the penny is decades into the future.\n\nYOUR SAVED PENNY MAY INCREASE IN VALUE\nStill, Little said, the gazillion pennies hoarded in piggy banks, sock drawers, and hiding under your car seats would gradually increase in value.\n\n“Pennies would become more scarce over time and eventually increase in value. In the near term, they might become useless, depending on how the Treasury treats them. I would think that would have to be in phases so people could convert them to other denominations, thus removing them from the system,” Little said.\n\nThere are pockets of population around the country where both of these outcomes matter. Laura Maike, of Burton, Ohio, notes that the Amish will feel the pinch right now.\n\n“Here in Northeast Ohio’s Amish country, we still use pennies regularly,” Maike said of her area, which includes thousands of generally cash-using Amish. “How would this work for cash-only transactions? It would be impossible to give exact change as the purchaser or seller.”\n\nMaike is more bullish, though, on a world in which the end of the penny means existing pennies increase in value.\n\n“I have a wheat penny sitting in my jewelry box because I knew when I found it nearly 20 years ago that they were becoming increasingly harder to find,” Maike said.\n\nPennies depicting two sheaves of wheat were discontinued in favor of today’s Lincoln versions in 1958.\n\nSmith said there are other benefits to getting rid of the heavy-to-transport pennies.\n\n“Eliminating the penny would save taxpayers millions of dollars each year. In addition, the production of pennies has environmental costs, including the mining of zinc and copper, eliminating the penny could have a positive environmental impact,” he said.\n\nSome Americans are reacting to the end of the penny with a sense of humor. “How will people give their two cents?” said Eileen Kailholz, a retiree in Bright, Indiana.\n\nBut it’s not entirely a joking matter. Nate Throckmorton, an associate professor of economics at William & Mary, says it may be time to start keeping an eye on another coin in your piggy bank: the nickel.\n\n“It’s the nickel we should worry about,” Throckmorton said.\n\nIt takes three cents to make a penny, but 11 cents to make a nickel.\n\nCheckout latest world news below links :\nWorld News || Latest News || U.S. News\n\nSource link\n\nThe post What the end of the penny means for the economy, your piggy bank, and the way America prices items appeared first on WorldNewsEra.",

Owned by Singapore based Tolaram, a diversified multinational group with operations across Africa, Asia, and Europe, Lagos Free Zone is strategically integrated with the Lekki Deep Sea Port and will provide an integrated industrial ecosystem for efficient import and export operations, serving as a gateway for Nigeria’s integration into global value chains.\nWith Nigeria’s economy projected to grow by 3.7% by 2026, investments in infrastructure are vital to ensuring sustainable growth. When fully occupied, Lagos Free Zone is expected to create approximately 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs, while contributing significantly to Nigeria’s GDP upon completion.\n”This investment reflects IFC’s commitment to fostering inclusive economic growth and sustainable development in Nigeria. Lagos Free Zone is poised to become a transformative hub for industrial activity, driving job creation and enhancing Nigeria’s competitiveness in global markets.

Approximately 15% of the investment is earmarked for climate-related initiatives, including Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE)-certified buildings and climate-resilient infrastructure.\n”IFC’s support represents a significant and positive recognition of our vision to establish Lagos Free Zone as a world-class industrial hub. This investment allows us to scale up the existing infrastructure to attract more foreign and local tenants while promoting sustainability and creating economic opportunities for Nigeria. Lagos Free Zone, integrated with Lekki Deep Sea Port, facilitates ease of doing business in Nigeria and supports the Federal Government of Nigeria’s drive for economic diversification and infrastructure development.
