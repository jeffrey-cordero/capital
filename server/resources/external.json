               "text": " BERLIN (AP) — German election winner Friedrich Merz sealed a deal Wednesday to form a new government that aims to spur economic growth, ramp up defense spending, take a tougher approach to migration and catch up on long-neglected modernization. \nThe agreement paves the way for new leadership in the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, which has Europe’s biggest economy. It follows months of political drift and weeks of negotiations as the continent faces uncertainty over the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs and its commitment to European allies’ defense. \nMerz is on track to become Germany’s new leader in early May, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \nThe 69-year-old’s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany’s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz’s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority. \n’GERMANY IS BACK ON TRACK’ \nBefore Merz can take the helm, the coalition deal needs approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats’ membership and by a convention on April 28 of Merz’s Christian Democratic Union party. Once those hurdles are cleared, the lower house of parliament — in which the allies have 328 of the 630 seats — can elect him as chancellor. \nMerz said the deal is “a very strong and clear signal to the people of our country, and also a clear signal to our partners in the European Union: Germany is getting a government that is capable of acting and will act strongly.” \nAsked about his message to the U.S. president, Merz replied: “The key message to Donald Trump is, Germany is back on track. Germany will fulfill the obligations in terms of defense and Germany is willing to strengthen their own competitiveness.” He added, ”We will bring the European Union forward.” \nThe prospective coalition embarked on one big project before even reaching a deal to govern together. Last month, it pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt, and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that’s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy. \nThat was an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to Germany’s self-imposed “debt brake.” \nECONOMY AND MIGRATION \nOther measures in the agreement are more in line with what he campaigned for. The coalition aims to boost companies’ investment and then cut corporate tax, make working overtime more attractive and cut electricity tax. \nMerz, the opposition leader at the time, made reducing migration central to his election campaign. On Wednesday, he said the new government will suspend family reunions for many migrants, designate more “safe countries of origin,” launch a “return offensive” for rejected asylum-seekers and turn some people back at Germany’s borders in consultation with neighbors. \nIt will also tighten a law passed by the outgoing government that eased the rules for gaining citizenship, scrapping the possibility for well-integrated applicants to get a German passport after three rather than five years of residence. \nTHROW OUT THE FAX MACHINES \nThe new government will include a “digitization ministry” to modernize a country that still has a reputation for tangled bureaucracy and old-fashioned paperwork. \n“Not everything has to be regulated down to the smallest detail,” said the Social Democrats’ co-leader, Lars Klingbeil. “The diggers must work and the fax machines in our country must be thrown away. Our economy must grow.” \nMerz said the coalition plans to reduce the size of the federal administration by 8% over its four-year term. But, referring to the United States’ Department of Government Efficiency, he said it doesn’t plan to do so by firing workers. “We’re not hiring an Elon Musk here who will do it like they dare in Washington,” he said. “We will do it ... sensibly, with a sense of proportion.” \nPRESSURE FROM ABROAD AND AT HOME \nThe election took place seven months earlier than planned after Scholz’s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting and widespread discontent. Germany, the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member, has been in political limbo since then. \nThe market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs added to pressure for Merz’s Union and the Social Democrats to bring their coalition talks to a conclusion. The tariffs threaten to add to the woes of an export-heavy economy that shrank for the past two years. \nAnother factor in the haste to reach an agreement was a decline for the Union in the opinion polls, showing support slipping from its election showing, while the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished a strong second in February, gained as the political vacuum persisted. \n“The political center in our country is in a position to solve the problems we face,” Merz said. Ministers will be named at a later date.",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Resilient demand from multinationals and a focus on short-term assets should help Santander’s trade finance fund weather a global trade war triggered by US tariffs, the fund’s leader says. \n\nUS President Donald Trump sent shockwaves through global trade last week with a barrage of tariffs on key trading partners, on top of existing duties on Canada and Mexico.\n\nBertrand de Comminges, who oversees the Trade Finance Real Economy Fund I managed by Santander Alternative Investments, says there is an “overall market consensus that these new tariffs, if they finally come into fruition, are a real risk for global economic growth and all economic players will be impacted either in their supply chains, their access to sources of capital and liquidity, or both”.\n\nEarlier this year, when tariffs had only been imposed on Canada, China and Mexico, the fund exited an investment in a company “particularly” hit by levies on US imports.\n\n“If a company deteriorates significantly and suffers an internal or external downgrade, we reserve the right to communicate the unwinding of our position immediately,” de Comminges tells GTR.\n\n“The beauty of trade finance, in many respects, for most of the asset classes, is its uncommitted, short-term nature. It allows you to react very quickly,” he says, adding the fund has also made investments where underlying borrowers stand to benefit from shifting trade flows.\n\n“We are worried about [the tariffs],” he says. “But at the end of the day, who are we funding? We are funding the supply chains of the top multinationals in the world. If there is a big crisis, they may reduce their sales and manufacturing, but they still need to finance several billion dollars of assets every month to keep their business model in place.”\n\nSantander said last month the fund had hit €1bn in inflows since its launch in June 2021, and invested over €5.1bn. \n\nSantander’s fund has two strategies: the first invests in risk participations on “high quality” programmes that partner banks have originated with large-cap investment-grade borrowers, and the second invests in SME lending portfolios held by non-bank financial institutions.\n\nInvestments in the first strategy have an average tenor of 25 days, with those in the second around 102. \n\nWhile multinationals have a greater ability to adapt to the volatility, de Comminges says there has been a “significant jump” in funding costs for SMEs and high-yield borrowers, which are more vulnerable to uncertainty. \n\n“This is a time to keep a cool mind,” he cautions. “Once a clear picture emerges and the end game settles, we´ll take longer-term decisions on our portfolio; albeit not losing the opportunity to react quickly.” \n\nCurrently, the large-cap strategy delivers net returns of Euribor plus 77 basis points to investors, with weekly liquidity, de Comminges says, while the SME strategy provides a 5.85% profit.\n\nThe fund’s underlying investments span receivables finance, supply chain finance, pre-export facilities and other trade instruments.\n\n\n\nOvercoming investor worries\n\nTrade finance funds have sometimes struggled to win the confidence of investors that are concerned about fraud and credit risk in the sector, or are simply unfamiliar with the asset class. \n\nSantander’s fund, as part of a large, global banking group, has advantages over the smaller outfits dotting the trade finance landscape. In the fund’s early phase, most of its investments were originated by Santander’s own trade finance team, according to a 2023 offering document. \n\nFor inflows, it also has easy access to the Spanish lender’s existing client base, such as corporations, family offices and institutional investors.\n\nDe Comminges, who left HSBC to launch the fund in 2021, says “probably the major challenge for trade finance funds” is that the performance indicators and metrics they use are less familiar to institutional investors and in the world of capital markets.\n\n“Trade financiers use a completely different jargon than capital markets and asset managers,” he says. “So, making that transition and being able to explain in the right language with the right jargon, what you’re investing in, I believe is a significant part of the success.”\n\nPotential investors, approached not long after a string of commodity trading fraud scandals that triggered losses at high-profile lenders, were cautious about the fraud risks in trade finance.\n\nDe Comminges says the fund tries to trim fraud risk through measures such as not financing commodities in transit, instead waiting until goods “touch the right harbour and they are actually on the balance sheet of the right entity”.\n\n“Trade finance is a fantastic set of asset classes, and we cannot be tempted by short-term high returns. If someone is paying you 10% or 8% for a trade finance trade, you may wonder why. There is no such thing as well-structured, secure trade paying you 8% returns.” \n\nDe Comminges says that funds are a necessary alternative in the trade finance market to capital-restricted banks.\n\n“In the past 12-14 years, big multinationals have kept growing, whilst the growth of the big banks that support these has been limited by regulation and other elements,” he says. “Therefore, a much more dynamic, proactive alternative for funding is required to support companies that operate in almost 200 countries.”\n\nThe post Santander trade finance fund head urges calm amid tariff upheaval appeared first on Global Trade Review (GTR).",

               "text": " LAGOS (Reuters) - The African Finance Corporation’s (AFC) revenue rose 22.8% last year to $1.1 billion, it said on Wednesday, citing project finance and infrastructure deals across Africa. \nThe AFC said the revenue performance was its strongest to date, adding that net income rose 22.3% to $400 million, up from $327 million a year ago. \nChief Executive Samaila Zubairu said the result shows that strategic investment in African infrastructure creates lasting value for beneficiaries and investors. \n”In 2024 we exceeded the billion-dollar revenue mark, delivered game-changing projects, and reinforced our financial resilience, demonstrating the scalability of our unique model that blends purpose with performance to accelerate Africa’s economic transformation,” Zubairu said. \nThe corporation said it mobilised capital for African projects ranging from energy to natural resources. \nSome of the projects funded included the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300km railway that connects Angola’s port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. \nThe AFC also said it invested $150 million in the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Complex in the DRC, Africa’s largest copper producer. \nIt provided financial support for the commissioning of the Dangote refinery, Africa’s largest, and continued to provide support for AFC-backed Infinity Power Holding’s 10GW clean energy target. \nThe corporation said it also invested in the 15GW Xlinks Morocco-UK Power Project, providing $14.1 million to support early stage development of a transcontinental renewable energy pipeline between North Africa and Europe. \n(Editing by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by David Goodman) \nBy Ben Ezeamalu",

               "text": "By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The global economy appeared to be in open rebellion against\nPresident Donald Trump’s tariffs as they took effect Wednesday.\n\nBusiness executives are warning of a potential recession caused by his policies,\nsome of the top U.S. trading partners are retaliating with their own import\ntaxes and the stock market is quivering after days of decline.\n\nTrump’s tariffs kicked in shortly after midnight, including 104% on products\nfrom China, 20% on the European Union, 24% on Japan and 25% on South Korea.\nAdministration officials have tried to reassure voters, Republican lawmakers and\nCEOs that the rates are negotiable, but by their own admission that process\ncould take months.\n\nWhen a downturn appears on the horizon, investors typically crowd into U.S.\nTreasury notes as a safe haven, viewing the federal government as a source of\nstability. Not this time. Government bond prices are down, pushing up the\ninterest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 4.39% in a sign that the\nworld is increasingly leery of Trump’s moves.\n\nJohn Bowers works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York,\nWednesday, April 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)The Republican president was\npublicly defiant as the stock market recovered slightly and then sold off in\nmorning trading.\n\n“THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” he posted on Truth Social, his social media\nsite. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and\nbetter than ever before!”\n\nPresidents often receive undue credit or blame for the state of the U.S. economy\nas their time in the White House is subject to financial and geopolitical forces\nbeyond their direct control. But by unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump is\nexerting extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political\nrisks that could prove difficult to avoid if his plans do not pan out. After\nearly success in exerting control over American institutions, from law firms and\nuniversities to federal agencies and cultural organizations, he is now facing\noff with global markets that will not simply bend to his will.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon said there would “probably” be a\nrecession, although he also deferred to his economists.\n\n“I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to\ndo,” he said in an interview with Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, left, is interviewed by Maria Bartiromo on the\n“Mornings with Maria Bartiromo” program, on the Fox Business Network, in New\nYork Wednesday, April 9, 2025.

Thom Tills as he launches a Senate campaign in the key southeastern battleground state of North Carolina. \n”Trump is shredding our Constitution and tanking our economy. Thom Tillis lacks the courage to stand up to him – I’ll be damned if I’m going to sit on the sidelines,” former Rep. Wiley Nickel argued in a social media post as he declared his candidacy for the Senate on Wednesday. \nNickel, an attorney who served as a staffer in former President Barack Obama’s administration before winning election as a state senator and later serving one term in Congress, is the first major Democrat to launch a campaign in the 2026 Senate race in North Carolina. \nTHIS POPULAR FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WHOM TRUMP URGED TO RUN PASSES ON 2026 SENATE BID IN KEY SWING STATE \nDemocrats see Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina as a possible vulnerability for Republicans in the 2026 midterms. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \nDemocrats haven’t won a Senate election in North Carolina since 2008, but they view Tillis as vulnerable. While Trump carried the state in his 2024 presidential election victory by three points – an improvement over his razor-thin margin in 2020 – Democrats won the statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state. \n”North Carolina needs a fighter for what’s right for our state, not a rubber stamp for Trump. That’s who Thom Tillis is,” Nickel charged in a campaign launch video posted to social media. \nPOLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS WITH AMERICANS 11 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND TOUR OF DUTY IN THE WHITE HOUSE \nNickel edged Republican Bo Hines in 2022 to flip a red congressional district blue. But he declined to seek re-election in 2024 after his district was redrawn to favor the GOP. \nIn his campaign video, Nickel charged that Republicans ”gerrymandered my district, so I couldn’t run again.” \nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which is the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, took aim at Nickel \nELON MUSK FRONT-AND-CENTER AS FIRST CANDIDATE IN KEY SENATE RACE LAUNCHES BID \n”Wiley Nickel is a far-left radical who wants illegal immigrants voting in our elections, drug dealers free on the streets, and parents kept from having a voice in their children’s education,” NRSC spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to Fox News. ”He’s so out-of-touch he chose to retire instead of facing voters in a tough election year, and he will be rejected by North Carolina voters in 2026.” \nWiley Nickel (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nWhile Nickel is the first major candidate to enter the race, many national and North Carolina Democrats are hoping that former Gov. Roy Cooper, who in January finished his two terms in office, will also run. \nWHY TRUMP, MUSK, FACE BLAME OVER BALLOT BOX SET BACKS LAST WEEK \nCooper, who was a popular governor, has yet to decide his next political step. \nRoy Cooper (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) \nNorth Carolina is a top target for the Democrats in 2026, along with Maine, where moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for re-election in the blue-leaning state. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \nRepublicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and in next year’s midterm elections they are targeting open Democrat-held seats in Michigan and New Hampshire as well as Georgia, where first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff is viewed as vulnerable. \nPaul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " CHARLESTON, W.Va. –The Birth to Three program hasn’t seen a rate increase for their practitioners in two decades and a bill that could give them that raise has stalled in the house, where it’s likely to stay. \nSenate Bill 707 aims to give the practitioners, who provide in-home services to children three and under, a 25% rate increase. The bill passed the senate on March 29 with a unanimous vote. The bill is now sitting in the House Finance Committee and Monday committee chair Vernon Criss said that he wouldn’t be taking the bill up. \nThe program, which serves all 55 counties, provides services over eight different areas, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, developmental, dietitian, social work, service coordination, and developmental specialist services. \nCindy Chamberlin, who is a physical therapist that serves Nicholas, Raleigh and Fayette counties said the program hasn’t seen a raise since April 1, 2003. \nShe says this causes discrepancies between their job and those who are newly graduated from school. \n“I made about a third of the money that a new grad can make going into a hospital and that’s a huge problem, because new grads are coming out of school with about $140,000 dollars in debt if there a physical therapist, and we don’t get loan forgiveness, even though we live in a rural state, we don’t get loan forgiveness because we’re not state employees,” Chamberlin said on MetroNews Talkline Wednesday morning. \nThe 900 independent practioners with the program, provide services to more than 7,000 kids. \nChamberlin said that the rate increase would help retain individuals for this type of work. \n“I want to be able to empower and educate somebody else and share the skills that I’ve learned over the last 25 years and pass that on to them, so when they come into our program, they have a better idea of what to expect,” she said. \nShe says that this program is vital for West Virginia because of the services that they provide. She also referenced a study from Arizona that states if you invest one dollar into early intervention while they are kids, then it will save $16 dollars later in medical, education and the judicial. \nShe said that these are the reasons that they are making themselves known at the capitol during the legislative session. \n“It’s frustrating, which is why we’ve had such a presence here at the capitol just to really talk about how important early intervention is, how important what we do is,” Chamberlin said. “Because we will be essentially saving money for our state by investing in our future which is our children.” \nAnother piece of legislation that would impact the program but in a good way would be House Bill 3365, which would appropriate funds to them because according to Chamberlin they ran out of funds in March for the current fiscal year. \n“That will bridge the gap or give us enough funding to get us to the end of our fiscal year on June 30, 2025,” Chamberlin said. \nShe said that they normally have enough money until the end of May, however they continue to serve more kids. In 2003, they served 2.4% of kids and now they serve 13%. \nThe legislative session ends on April 12th.",

               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": " (Reuters) -The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to scrap two consumer finance rules adopted under former President Joe Biden that capped bank overdraft fees and gave officials the power to supervise the legal compliance of tech companies’ digital wallets and payment apps. \nSince similar resolutions have already passed the U.S. Senate, they now await President Donald Trump’s signature. \nThe votes advance Republican efforts to enact a broad reversal of Biden-era regulations, coinciding with Trump’s wholesale moves to shrink the federal government. \nThe measures passed largely along party lines, with the thin Republican majority prevailing in both cases. Under federal law, if Trump signs the resolutions, the regulations will then be rescinded and the government barred from adopting similar regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. \nIn the Biden administration’s final weeks, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adopted the rules over Republican and industry groups’ objections, as they contended the agency’s actions were unjustified and exceeded its authority. \nThe overdraft rule would in most cases have capped such charges at $5. The so-called larger participants rule would have exposed tech companies offering payment services, like Apple Wallet, Google Pay, and others to government supervision in much the same manner as banks -- something the banking sector supported by Silicon Valley strongly opposed. \nAccording to the CFPB, banks sometimes unfairly imposed overdraft fees that helped drive corporate profits but extracted billions every year from millions of households. \n(Reporting by Douglas Gillison; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

They also called out Mayor Eric Adams for refusing to criticize Trump over the issue.\nThe escalating series of tariffs between the United States and trading partners like China and the European Union, which Trump  set off last week, sent the stock market into a volatile frenzy and caused widespread fear of soaring prices.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nCity Council Speaker and another mayoral candidate Adrienne Adams, during an April 9 news conference before Trump’s announcement, said the president’s tariffs will hurt “small businesses, working families, and everyday New Yorkers.”\n“Trump is sabotaging our economy with the largest tax hike in over 50 years,” the speaker said. “This continued chaos, if allowed to continue, will devastate New York City and the entire United States.”\nThe speaker said once the tariffs are fully implemented, New Yorkers could see spikes in prices for consumer goods like groceries and electronics. She also noted that the tariffs threaten over 260,000 jobs in the city .\n“Trump compares this chaos to a bitter pill that we all need to swallow; try telling that to a New Yorker that’s living paycheck to paycheck, try telling that to a family that is already drowning in rent and child care costs,” said City Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan, who was also present at the press conference.\nThe City Council called for setting aside nearly $2 billion in its Fiscal Year 2026 Preliminary Budget Response to prepare for Trump’s funding cuts. Brannan said the council wants to be ready to plug that money into any funding gaps created by Trump’s sweeping cuts to federal grants and other economic turmoil caused by his policies.\n“Trump compares this chaos to a bitter pill that we all need to swallow; try telling that to a New Yorker that’s living paycheck to paycheck, try telling that to a family that is already drowning in rent and child care costs,” said City Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan, who was also present at the press conference.Gerardo Romo / NYC Council Media Unit\nHowever, Speaker Adams said those funds would not be enough to mitigate the effects of Trump’s tariffs if they ultimately take full effect.\n“This will be a self-inflicted injury so severe that no amount of fiscal management can contain it,” the speaker said. “Despite our preparation for economic risks on the city level, we can only do so much to blunt the most devastating consequences.”\nAdditionally, Brannan said the mayor’s budget office has not yet recognized the $2 billion in revenue, and he said they want to reset it aside.  Disputes between the City Council and the mayor’s office over the projected revenue the city has at its disposal have dominated the last few budget cycles and could play a major role again this year.\n‘Compromised if not continuing to collude’\nMayor Eric Adams insisted his warm relationship with President Trump is benefitting New York City. Tuesday, April 8, 2025.Credit: Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office.\nBoth Speaker Adams and Brannan also criticized the mayor for his tepid comments on the tariffs over the past couple of days. Brannan charged that Mayor Adams is not adequately fighting back against the Trump administration’s aggressive actions targeting the city in the wake of the Justice Department dropping his criminal indictment .\n“We have an administration at City Hall that is compromised if not continuing to collude with the federal government,” Brannan said.\nThe mayor’s reluctance to criticize Trump has become a frequent point of attack by his critics, who allege he is beholden to the Republican president.\nFor his part, the mayor has said he does not know enough about tariffs  despite claiming that he spent much of last weekend reading about them. Nonetheless, he appeared to show general support for Trump’s attempt to shake up the status quo.\n“There’s one thing I know: whatever we were doing, it was not working,” Adams said during a Tuesday news conference. “Affordability is an issue for everyday New Yorkers. Wealth has been accumulated in the highest level of people in the country. And I’m seeing low-income, working-class people struggling every day. And so whatever we were doing, we need to think differently.”\nAbout the Author\nEthan Stark-Miller covers New York City and state politics for amNewYork Metro.\nRelated Articles",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " April 9, 2025 - WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Tuesday, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu were joined by Representatives Adam Gray, Tim Kennedy and Andrea Salinas for a press conference on the reckless Republican tariffs that are crashing the economy and draining the retirement accounts of Americans. \nCongressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Los Angeles County) \nCHAIRMAN AGUILAR: Good morning. Pleased to be joined with Representatives Gray, Kennedy and Salinas here today. On behalf of the Vice Chair and I, we also are pleased to welcome the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Washington, D.C. area. Look forward to catching a game this homestand. \nDonald Trump has imposed the largest tax increase in 50 years on every single American. Republican incompetence is crashing the economy with reckless tariffs and bleeding the accounts, the retirement accounts, of Americans dry. We’re watching a global recession take hold because of the boneheaded policies of one person—which will cause hardworking people to lose their jobs, potentially lose their homes and their health care. At the same time, Republicans in Congress are preparing to cut Medicaid by $880 billion so they can give a massive tax cut to billionaires. They are telling us with a straight face—that the economic growth will pay for these tax breaks—while the economy is in a tailspin. The truth is, passing the Republican budget would be a death blow to the American economy. And the people that get caught in the crossfire of this Republican Recession will be hurt the most by Medicaid as a tool that Republicans want to chip away at. Congress needs to take away the keys of economic policies like tariffs from this incompetent Administration and restore some stability to the economy. House Democrats are going to continue to prioritize the economic needs of the American people by working to bring down costs, make health care more affordable and looking out for everyday Americans. With that, I’ll turn it over to Vice Chair Ted Lieu. \nVICE CHAIR LIEU: Thank you, Chairman Aguilar. As an American and as a veteran, my heart goes out to the four U.S. soldiers who tragically died in an accident in Lithuania. The Lithuanian President did a very dignified ceremony for those four U.S. soldiers. And when those four soldiers’ caskets landed at Dover Air Force Base last Friday, at a transfer ceremony, U.S. officials greeted them, elected officials greeted them, but Donald Trump was not there. Donald Trump instead chose to go to a golf tournament, and I’m just going to read to you what one of the persons at this ceremony said. He deployed to Iraq. His name is Blythe Potter. He’s a Military Police Corps veteran. He said, ‘I have never been so embarrassed to be an American.’ President Trump should have been at that transfer ceremony for the four fallen U.S. soldiers, instead of at his golf tournament.  \nI now want to also echo what Chairman Aguilar said about the tariffs. They are a tax on the American consumer. As all of you know, the way tariffs work is when the foreign products come to our ports, the American company that imported those products pays the tariff, not the foreign country. And what happens when this American company pays that tariff? Well, they’re going to pass on those costs to the consumer and the prices are going to increase. And poll after poll, we see that the overwhelming majority of American people oppose tariffs. There are ways to try to make competition more fair, but let’s not do it by increasing prices on Americans. \nAnd their estimates, it’s going to be about $3,800 per family in terms of increased costs. And then let me also now congratulate Susan Crawford for winning the Wisconsin Supreme Court race last week. What we saw there was the world’s wealthiest man, Elon Musk, tried to buy the election, spending over $20 million, and the people of Wisconsin figured that out, and they overwhelmingly elected Susan Crawford. So, what was once Elon Musk’s greatest asset, his money, has now become his greatest liability because the people now understand that he’s trying to buy elections, and they overwhelmingly vote against that. \nAnd then the Hands Off protests that we saw this past weekend were amazing. The American people are waking up, that Trump and Republicans’ policies are harming our nation. So now it is my honor to introduce my friend Adam Gray, who I had the honor of serving with in the California State Legislature. So thrilled he is now in Congress and represents the Central Valley. \nREP. GRAY: Good morning, and thank you Chairman Aguilar and Vice Chair Lieu for inviting me to speak with you this morning. I represent California’s San Joaquin Valley, the world’s largest agricultural region. The President’s recent announcement of tariffs on our global trade partners poses a serious risk to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley and across the country. The last time blanket tariffs went into effect under President Trump’s first administration, California farmers lost an estimated $683 million in crop revenue. The most significant losses were concentrated in tree nuts and dairy products, among others, which are top exports from the San Joaquin Valley.  \nIn fact, the California delegation recently received a letter from ag industry leaders in California pleading with Congress to support common-sense measures that will protect fair competition for their products and defend our nation’s food supply. This group of producers represent more than 400 commodities and billions of dollars of revenue. They warn of uncertain market conditions, disrupted business operations, increased costs associated with retaliatory tariffs. This all poses a significant risk to family-owned farms, which account for over 95% of American agricultural operations. I grew up in the ag industry. My family owned and operated a dairy supply store. My grandparents grew pistachios. Like many Valley families, I know personally how tight budgets are. I know how one bad season can derail an operation for years. These aren’t just individual farmers or business owners who will lose jobs or shutter businesses. These are entire communities like mine in the Central Valley who rely on the ag industry to power their economy.  \nRather than work with Congress to make precise, strategic changes to our trade policy, the President has decided to impose sloppy, blanket tariffs and stuck American farmers with the bill. I’m ready to work with anyone and everyone who is serious about rising above partisan politics to protect our ag communities from the impacts of tariffs. We must do something now. Our farmers deserve it. Our communities deserve it. With that, I’m happy to introduce my colleague, Representative Tim Kennedy. \nREP. KENNEDY: Morning. First, I want to thank Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu for not only bringing us together this morning, but for their continued leadership on this issue and so many other issues. Before Trump’s tariffs plunged us and the entire world into chaos. Western New Yorkers that I represent were sounding the alarm on the President’s trade war. As a representative of a border community in Buffalo in the Niagara region and the Co-Chair of the Northern Border Caucus, families in my region know how important our ties are with our Canadian neighbors. In my district, trade with Canada supports tens of thousands of jobs, nearly 30,000 jobs, and brings in over a half a billion dollars in purchases by Canadians every year. Across the border, there’s $1.3 trillion of commerce every single year, billions of dollars a day, supporting states all across the northern border, but all across our great country. Again, in Western New York, Canadians pour over the border, whether it’s going to a Bills game or a Sabres game or shopping or using our restaurants, sleeping at our hotels, over 40 percent of the 5 million enplanements out of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport are Canadian citizens. \nOur economies are reliant upon each other and benefit from the tremendous relationship that we have, economically, culturally, historically and presently. However, Trump’s tariffs are putting our hardworking families in Western New York at risk, and it’s hurting our entire national and international economy. Cross-border traffic is down by double digits from last year, robbing small businesses across the country of tourism dollars. Tariffs that are being put in place across the borders, these blanket tariffs, including on things like lumber, that are hurting homeownership, especially new homeowners. They’re also stymieing development and other industries, including steel fabrication, auto manufacturing, craft brewing, logistics. Every industry across the board is worrying about supply chain disruption, skyrocketing operating costs and keeping their employees on the payroll. Businesses are going to be hurt by these tariffs. Jobs are going to be lost in our country because of these tariffs, because our economy is so tightly intertwined with Canada’s. People in my district and across the country are being hit right in their pocketbook already. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is golfing at his own club while trillions of dollars are wiped away from American citizens and hardworking families and their retirements that they were dependent upon, as we risk this Republican Recession. \nBut Trump’s tariffs aren’t just robbing folks of their retirement savings and driving up the cost of housing, groceries, clothes and gas, his indiscriminate blanket tariffs are putting our allies on the same playing field as our adversaries. Trump inherited an improving economy with low unemployment, and he crashed it. He inherited the strong alliance and friendships we have with Canada, with our European allies, with our global allies, and he crushed them. Trump’s tariffs sent a message to our friends and allies that we no longer are the reliable partners that they can depend upon, and hardworking families in Western New York and across the country are paying the price. They are setting our nation down a dangerous path of chaos, stealing from American families and jeopardizing our alliances, all to justify tax cuts for the richest Americans. This is wrong, and we’re not going to stand for it. We’re not going to sit back and hang tough like the president suggests we do. We’re going to continue to use our voices and demand an end to Trump’s tariffs and get back to work creating an economy that benefits all hardworking families across this great country. With that, I yield to a wonderful Representative Salinas. \nREP. SALINAS: Well, thank you, Chair Aguilar, Vice Chair Lieu and everyone for being here today. As my colleagues have already pointed out, President Trump’s tariffs have created chaos and uncertainty across the country and around the world. Many Americans have spent the last few days watching their retirement savings go up in smoke and bracing for a recession or possibly worse. But instead of doing something to stop the bleeding, Donald Trump spent the weekend, as has already been mentioned, playing golf with billionaires. In case there was any confusion about where his priorities are, he clearly is more interested in improving his golf game than improving the economy. \nTrump’s reckless and harmful approach to tariffs will devastate states like Oregon, where our economy relies heavily on trade. From wine to wood products, Oregon exports billions of dollars worth of homegrown goods every year and we import billions more. All things considered, Trump’s tariffs are going to raise taxes on Oregon businesses and families to a tune of about $7.5 billion per year. So, whether you’re a hazelnut grower in the Willamette Valley or a small business owner in Salem, hardworking Americans, not foreign countries, will end up footing the bill. And those costs add up. Experts have estimated that the average family will pay about $73 more per week, or close to $4,000 more per year for everyday necessities. It’s frankly reprehensible that this President is choosing, and I want to be clear, this is a choice, to play roulette with people’s hard-earned money, and roll the dice on whether our folks can afford food, pay the rent, send their kids to college or even retire right now. \nAnd don’t be fooled, this is not a market correction. It is a market disruption of the highest magnitude. I won’t stand for it. My colleagues will not stand for it. House Democrats are united in our opposition to Trump’s tariff tyranny, and we will continue to speak out against his attacks on working families. What we won’t do is let Republicans in Congress off the hook. They have the power to stop this, these tariffs, right now, and they’re refusing to fulfill their constitutional duty. Our message is clear: Democrats will not bow down to billionaires. We will fight back with everything we have to protect our constituents from the great Republican Rip Off. Thank you. \nVideo of the full press conference and Q&A can be viewed here. \nSource: House Democrats",

Less than two hours earlier, he had retreated from his plans to increase tariffs on many U.S. trading partners, and investors were rejoicing after bracing for a global economic meltdown.\n“You’ve got the markets seeing your brilliance,” Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, told the president.\nTrump agreed. “Nobody’s ever heard of it,” he declared.\nIt was a typical bit of hyperbole that, in this case, was true. Even by the standards of Trump’s second term, the saga that had played out over the past week left the world struggling to catch its breath.\nThe president, of his own doing, had single-handedly pushed the global economy to the brink of chaos with new tariffs. The stock market cratered, businesses tore up their plans and foreign leaders prepared for a future without the world’s richest nation at the center of international trade.\nAnd then Trump backed down. Seven days after announcing what would have amounted to America’s largest tax hike since World War II in an elaborate Rose Garden ceremony, he rolled back most of the tariffs in a surprise post on his social media website.\n”I think the word would be flexible,” he said later despite days of insisting that he wouldn’t bend. “You have to be flexible.”\nUncertainty lingers as trade talks continue\nIt was unclear what the president had accomplished, beyond the satisfaction of, in his words, having other countries “kissing my ass” to try to talk him out of the tariffs. No new trade deals have been reached, although administration officials said negotiations are underway.\nHowever, real damage has been done. The back-and-forth over tariffs shook confidence in U.S. leadership, exposed fractures within Trump’s team and rattled companies that rely on global sources for products and international customers for sales. Americans who use the stock market to save for retirement and college suffered days of angst.\nThe turmoil isn’t over yet, either. Trump’s 10% blanket tariffs initially imposed on Saturday are now applied to dozens of nations. He also jacked up tariffs to 125% on imports from China, leaving the world bracing for a showdown between the first and second largest economies. There are 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America’s largest trading partners, as well as 25% taxes on imported autos, steel and aluminum.\nOther tariffs — including 24% on Japan, 25% on South Korea, 20% on the European Union — are on hold for 90 days to allow for trade talks.\n“This just accentuates the policy uncertainty and sense of unreliability Trump is creating,’’ said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. While Reinsch said it’s good news that Trump didn’t move forward with some of his highest tariffs, “how does anybody know that he won’t change his mind on Friday or next week?”\nTrump makes his announcement on ‘Liberation Day’\nU.S. flags were draped along the White House colonnade for a red-white-and-blue backdrop when Trump announced his tariffs on Wednesday, April 2.\n“My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,” he said. The president held up a poster listing the tariffs that he would slap on each country — 32% for Thailand, 49% for Cambodia, 26% for India, and on and on. People around the world squinted to decipher the numbers that would reset critical economic relationships.\nTrump has been fixated on international trade for decades, long before entering politics. His central concern is trade deficits, meaning the U.S. imports more than it exports.\nBut the focus puzzles mainstream economists, who don’t view the situation with the same level of alarm. It’s no surprise, they said, that a rich nation like the U.S. would buy more than it sells, and they’re generally skeptical that tariffs alone would eliminate trade deficits.\nHowever, Trump declared that it was a “national emergency” that would allow him to push tariffs without congressional approval. His tariffs were not based on the import taxes charged by other countries but by the size of each trade deficit , a calculation that instantly discredited the policy with many economists and investors. Also baffling were the tariffs placed on Heard and McDonald Islands, which are mainly populated by penguins.\nThe day after the announcement, Trump jetted to Florida for the weekend.\n“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” he promised while leaving the White House, the whirring rotors of Marine One sometimes overpowering his voice. “And the rest of the world wants to see if there is any way they can make a deal.”\nBut the market was crashing, posting its biggest single-day loss since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic five years earlier. And it didn’t get any better as Trump attended a Saudi-funded tournament at his Miami golf course and participated in a candle-lit dinner for an allied political organization.\nOn the flight back to Washington on Sunday evening, Trump told reporters that he won a club championship.\n“It’s good to win,” he said. ”You heard I won, right?”\nBut around the country and the world, the fallout was spreading.\nFulcrum Coffee Roasters in Seattle braced for rising costs for beans from Southeast Asia and espresso machines from Italy. Stellantis, the automaker behind brands like Jeep and Ram, announced it would pause production at plants in Mexico and Canada, leading to temporary layoffs at other facilities in Indiana and Michigan, a reminder of how interconnected vehicle supply chains have become.\nThe Dutch division of Tata Steel said it would cut 1,600 employees, about a fifth of its workforce. Ireland Prime Minister Michael Martin said “there is no way to sugar coat” the situation as business with the U.S. started tapering off. Sri Lanka worried that its economic recovery would be derailed as its clothing industry faced new tariffs from its most important export market.\nTrump faces growing pushback from his own party\nThe markets were still in a panic on Monday when an unverified report circulated that the president was considering a 90-day pause on the tariffs. Stocks briefly soared before investors realized the information was wrong.\n“We’re not looking at that,” Trump said as hopes for the rumored reprieve vanished.\nBy Tuesday, with fears of a recession growing, Trump’s closest advisers began publicly sparring with one another. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who leads the administration’s efforts to trim the size of government, openly questioned the wisdom of the tariffs, which would raise costs for his electric automaker Tesla. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted that Musk “doesn’t understand” the situation. Musk fired back that Navarro was “truly a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks.”\nRepublican lawmakers returning to the Capitol for the workweek were peppered with questions about the tariffs and what they would do in response. Some began voicing support for legislation meant to rein in a president’s tariff powers, before the White House struck back forcefully with a veto threat.\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was asked on Tuesday if he understood Trump’s strategy, and responded by asking “does anybody?” Some of his state’s premier companies like Kohl’s expected higher costs, while its dairy farms expected to struggle to sell milk and cheese. Harley-Davidson was a target of planned reciprocal tariffs by the European Union.\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was even more blunt that day during a hearing with Trump’s top trade representative, Jamieson Greer. If the tariff plans don’t work, he said, “I’m just trying to figure out whose throat I need to choke.” His state’s farmers, who raise hogs and grow tobacco among other products, feared getting caught in the crossfire of a trade war, while local manufacturers and tech companies could face higher prices on what they export to foreign consumers.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge fund manager with intimate knowledge of the financial sector, held a round of meetings on Capitol Hill, including a lunch with Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana.\nKennedy had grown concerned about the tariffs, and he said they “talked very frankly.” He was part of a group of senators who sat down for an interview with Sean Hannity on Tuesday night in hopes of swaying Trump’s mind through one of his favorite Fox News hosts.\nTrump had been brushing off concerns about the tariffs and the market collapse by saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”\nKennedy wasn’t convinced, even if he shared the president’s concerns about unfair trade practices.\n“We don’t know if the medicine will be worse than the disease,” he said.\nTrump retreats, and aides call it part of the strategy all along\nThe tariffs on allies like Japan, South Korea and the European Union took effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, and there were no signs that Trump would back down when the sun came up in Washington.\n“BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well,” he posted on Truth Social.\nTrump also wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” — advice that turned out to be fortuitous. The president later said he’d been talking with his aides that morning about pausing the tariffs, an announcement that would send the stock market soaring.\nGreer was back on Capitol Hill for another hearing when Trump made his announcement.\nRep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, asked if Trump’s trade representative knew that the tariffs he had just spent at least two hours defending had been paused.\n“I understand the decision was made a few minutes ago,” Greer said.\nHorsford erupted, saying “this is amateur hour, and it needs to stop.”\nAt the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt scolded reporters for not understanding the president’s plans.\n“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” she said, referencing Trump’s book from 1987. “You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.”\nBut the administration sent mixed messages even as it rolled back the tariffs.\nBessent said the decision had nothing to do with the markets.\n“This was driven by the president’s strategy,” he told reporters outside the West Wing. “He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along.”\nTrump later contradicted Bessent.\n“I was watching the bond market,” he said. “That bond market is very tricky.”\nDespite the retreat, Trump showed no signs of regret. He was seeing dollar signs as he chatted with championship race car drivers in the Oval Office.\nIn a video posted by one of his aides, the president gestured to two corporate executives.\n“He made $2.5 billion today, and he made $900 million,” he said. “That’s not bad.”\nReporting was contributed by Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Stephen Groves in Washington, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Sri Lanka, Brian Melley in London, Molly Quell in Amsterdam and Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nLet the news come to you\nGet any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.",

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was asked on Tuesday if he understood Trump’s strategy, and responded by asking “does anybody?” Some of his state’s premier companies like Kohl’s expected higher costs, while its dairy farms expected to struggle to sell milk and cheese. Harley-Davidson was a target of planned reciprocal tariffs by the European Union. \nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was even more blunt that day during a hearing with Trump’s top trade representative, Jamieson Greer. If the tariff plans don’t work, he said, “I’m just trying to figure out whose throat I need to choke.” His state’s farmers, who raise hogs and grow tobacco among other products, feared getting caught in the crossfire of a trade war, while local manufacturers and tech companies could face higher prices on what they export to foreign consumers. \nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge fund manager with intimate knowledge of the financial sector, held a round of meetings on Capitol Hill, including a lunch with Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana. \nKennedy had grown concerned about the tariffs, and he said they “talked very frankly.” He was part of a group of senators who sat down for an interview with Sean Hannity on Tuesday night in hopes of swaying Trump’s mind through one of his favorite Fox News hosts. \nTrump had been brushing off concerns about the tariffs and the market collapse by saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” \nKennedy wasn’t convinced, even if he shared the president’s concerns about unfair trade practices. \n“We don’t know if the medicine will be worse than the disease,” he said. \nTRUMP RETREATS, AND AIDES CALL IT PART OF THE STRATEGY ALL ALONG \nThe tariffs on allies like Japan, South Korea and the European Union took effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, and there were no signs that Trump would back down when the sun came up in Washington. \n“BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well,” he posted on Truth Social. \nTrump also wrote: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” — advice that turned out to be fortuitous. The president later said he’d been talking with his aides that morning about pausing the tariffs, an announcement that would send the stock market soaring. \nGreer was back on Capitol Hill for another hearing when Trump made his announcement. \nRep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, asked if Trump’s trade representative knew that the tariffs he had just spent at least two hours defending had been paused. \n“I understand the decision was made a few minutes ago,” Greer said. \nHorsford erupted, saying “this is amateur hour, and it needs to stop.” \nAt the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt scolded reporters for not understanding the president’s plans. \n“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” she said, referencing Trump’s book from 1987. “You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here.” \nBut the administration sent mixed messages even as it rolled back the tariffs. \nBessent said the decision had nothing to do with the markets. \n“This was driven by the president’s strategy,” he told reporters outside the West Wing. “He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along.” \nTrump later contradicted Bessent. \n“I was watching the bond market,” he said. “That bond market is very tricky.” \nDespite the retreat, Trump showed no signs of regret. He was seeing dollar signs as he chatted with championship race car drivers in the Oval Office. \nIn a video posted by one of his aides, the president gestured to two corporate executives. \n“He made $2.5 billion today, and he made $900 million,” he said. “That’s not bad.” \n---------------------------------------- \nReporting was contributed by Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Stephen Groves in Washington, Jamey Keaten in Geneva, Bharatha Mallawarachi in Sri Lanka, Brian Melley in London, Molly Quell in Amsterdam and Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina.",

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "April 10th, 2025 – San Francisco, United States/California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> HUMA FINANCE, THE FIRST PAYFI NETWORK, ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF HUMA 2.0, A PERMISSIONLESS, COMPLIANT, AND COMPOSABLE REAL-YIELD PLATFORM BUILT ON SOLANA TODAY.\n\nThis launch opens global access to Huma’s stable real yield from global payment financing related to everyday commerce and trade activities. This development broadens individual access to stable, real-world yield—historically more common in institutional finance—by leveraging payment-financing mechanisms. Simultaneously, the existing permissioned service has been rebranded as Huma Institutional to continue serving institutions and accredited investors. Users can begin depositing on the new Huma 2.0 platform immediately.\n\nHuma 2.0 offers users alternative ways to participate as liquidity providers. It introduces two primary modes to cater to different user preferences: Classic Mode, designed for those seeking stable, double-digit USDC yield (updated monthly) combined with rewards called Huma Feathers; and Maxi Mode, tailored for users aiming to maximize their accumulation of Huma Feathers, earning rewards at 5x the base rate, without receiving USDC yield. Users can switch the mode of their existing positions at any time.\n\nDeFi composability is also a core feature of Huma 2.0, enabled by the PST, short for PayFi Strategy Token. This liquid, yield-bearing LP token allows holders to integrate their Huma positions with leading protocols on Solana. At launch, users can swap PST for USDC via Jupiter, the first of several planned integrations with top Solana DeFi platforms. Support for using PST as collateral on Kamino and trading future rewards via RateX are expected shortly after launch. While participation does not require capital lock-up, users can opt for 3-month or 6-month terms to significantly boost their Huma Feather rewards via multipliers. Notably, during the initial launch period, these multipliers are significantly elevated as part of a limited-time promotion, offering particularly high boosts in Maxi Mode. These features offer users enhanced flexibility and choice in managing their positions.\n\nIn just two years, Huma Finance’s PayFi Network has rapidly achieved significant scale, processing over $3.8 billion in transactions and generating $8 million in annualized revenue. Huma supports its partners to generate yield from their PayFi operations. Unlike DeFi yields often reliant on token incentives, market speculation, or typically low rates in traditional finance, PayFi yield originates directly from fees paid by businesses using the network for payment financing and settlement liquidity. Capital is recycled rapidly—often within days—compounding fees generated from tangible economic activity. This mechanism has enabled Huma to consistently deliver stable, double-digit USDC yields, showcasing a sustainable model further validated by backing from leading investors and recognition from industry analysts like Messari regarding PayFi’s potential to address a $30 trillion market.\n\n“Huma 2.0 isn’t just another yield product — it’s a structural shift.” Said Erbil Karaman, Co-founder of Huma Finance. “By giving payments institutions a new source of liquidity that operates 24/7 with incredible capital efficiency, we are creating a new type of yield that is composable, transparent, and grounded in real economic activity. It finally gives DeFi access to a source of returns that institutions have kept to themselves for decades — and it does so without compromising on what makes DeFi powerful.”\n\nThe launch of Huma 2.0 comes during significant shifts in global finance and within the DeFi landscape itself. While legacy payment infrastructures like SWIFT face challenges with speed and transparency and trillions in capital remain inefficiently allocated, the demand for modern, blockchain-based solutions is clear, evidenced by stablecoin transaction volumes recently reaching a reported $35 trillion. Huma 2.0 leverages this shift, providing efficient settlement liquidity and broadening access for individuals worldwide to earn from foundational financial activities – an opportunity previously confined mainly to institutions.\n\nCrucially, the yield generated through PayFi is designed to be less dependent on crypto market cycles. Whether markets are booming or in a downturn, economic activities like payments and trade may continue, potentially offering a more stable foundation for Huma’s yield generation. This structure may make double-digit returns more relevant during bear markets, where speculative yields often decline. As DeFi matures, there is a readiness for this type of yield – one grounded in tangible commerce rather than token speculation. PayFi serves as a foundational layer, enabling new DeFi strategies like the recent Solmate product from Splyce, which combines Huma’s PST yield with SOL liquid staking, bridging decentralized finance with productive economic use.\n\nHuma 2.0 marks a key step in building a new financial future, fundamentally expanding participation by inviting everyone into a financial revolution where access is open and fair. Early participants can benefit from various reward multipliers, including boosts for prior Huma depositors and partner communities. As the platform expands with more DeFi integrations and plans to be the first major project on Jupiter’s LFG 2.0 launchpad – Huma continues to build finance that is truly accessible.\n\nTo learn more about Huma 2.0 or participate, users can visit https://huma.finance or follow @humafinance on X.\n\nFor media inquiries, users can contact: Ejiro Oviri, ejiro@huma.finance.\n\nAbout Huma Finance\n\nHuma is the first PayFi (Payment Finance) network.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Economists expected the US to add 130,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate to increase to 4.2%. \nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images \nAs of March, the US labor market remained on solid footing: Job gains were broad-based and better than expected and participation picked up. \nHowever, a lot has changed for the US economy — and the world — in the first few days of April. President Donald Trump levied sweeping and steep tariffs against American trading partners, a move that sent markets plunging and triggered a trade war. \n“Liberation Day” and its aftermath were not reflected in the March jobs data released Friday. However, the employment snapshot provided a critical look as to how the labor market is holding up as Trump slashes federal spending (and jobs) and how it could weather increasingly turbulent times. \nThe US economy added a stronger-than-expected 228,000 jobs in March, a significant increase from February’s downwardly revised gains of 117,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. The robust gains notched in March were likely a rebound after wildfires and bad weather depressed job growth in January and February (which were revised down by a combined 48,000 jobs). \nThe unemployment rate in March ticked higher to 4.2% from 4.1%, driven higher in part by new entrants to the labor market. \nEconomists were expecting job growth to slow to 130,000 in March and for the unemployment rate to tick up to 4.2%, according to FactSet. \nThe March employment data is the “calm before the potential tariff-related storms,” Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, told CNN in an interview. The tariff actions could trigger stagflation, where economic growth stagnates and inflation and unemployment rise, she said. \nIn that scenario, “prices are rising faster than [people] want; growth is weak; and there will be some layoffs that will follow the demand destruction that could happen from tariffs being implemented,” she said. “We don’t anticipate a recession, but you could certainly see weaker growth, higher inflation and a hit — either major or minor — to the labor market if these tariffs and also retaliatory tariffs on the US go forward.” \nUS stocks were battered by a sell-off Friday after China retaliated against the United States for Trump’s tariffs in a tit-for-tat that escalates a global trade war. US stocks futures were off their morning lows ahead of the jobs report but ticked lower as investors digested the data. \nThe Dow was lower by 1,450 points, or 3.6%. The broader S&P 500 was 4.1% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 4.1% lower. \n‘Great job numbers’ but ‘old news’ \nMarch’s report marked another solid month of job gains and a continuation of a historic streak for the labor market. The US has now added jobs for 51 months in a row, marking the second-longest expansion on record, BLS data shows. \nWhether that continues, however, remains to be seen. \nRecent economic data has indicated that uncertainty and layoffs are on the rise amid some monumental policy shifts from the Trump administration, including large-scale federal layoffs, funding cutbacks, mass deportations, and tariffs. One of the biggest moves came just this week, when Trump imposed a colossal set of new tariffs on America’s trading partners. \n“The March employment report indicates that the labor market was in good shape as of last month, but its old news considering the Trump administration’s tariff announcement and ensuing global market rout,” Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide’s chief economist, wrote in a note to investors on Friday. \nPresident Donald Trump on Friday touted the strong gains in a post on his Truth Social platform. \n“Great job numbers, far better than expected,” he wrote. “It’s already working.” \nFor nearly five years, the labor market has been the solid foundation underpinning consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of all economic activity. During the past year, job gains have slowed (an expected normalization after the pandemic), and the labor market has not collapsed. \nHowever, while layoffs remain historically low, hiring and quitting activity have cooled, and economists have cautioned that the the slowdown in “churn” makes the labor market more susceptible to negative shocks. \n“Today’s jobs report is a welcome sign, given the negative indicators we saw leading into it,” said Ger Doyle, US country manager at employment agency Manpower Group. “While the US labor market is proving to be resilient, there are signs of cooling that are consistent with employers navigating uncertainty.” \nThe DOGE ‘slow drip’ \nThough the ripple effects from tariffs and immigration-related activities could take longer to show up in the data, the federal workforce reductions have already started appearing. The sector has posted job losses for two consecutive months, dropping 11,000 jobs in February and 4,000 jobs in March, BLS data shows. \nThe Department of Government Efficiency’s actions weren’t expected to have a big impact just yet: While nearly 300,000 job cuts have been announced, not all federal workers were laid off immediately, so the impact to the labor market and unemployment is going to be a slow drip. \nThat being said, there’s a multiplier effect when these jobs are lost, contractors are given the boot and, especially, funding is cut. Sectors such as health care as well as state and local government will be important to watch closely to get a sense as to how these drastic policy changes are shaking the private sector. \nThe federal government job losses were more than offset by employment gains in state and local government — the two sectors that were primarily responsible for public sector job gains, especially in recent years. In total, the sector added 19,000 jobs in March. \nThe bulk of last month’s overall job gains came in the services sector, with health care and social assistance continuing to drive strong payroll growth (adding 77,800 jobs). Employment in leisure and hospitality rebounded in March, adding 43,000 jobs after posting losses in January and February, when wildfires and cold weather affected activity. \nJob growth was more muted in goods-producing sectors, especially among makers of durable goods. That industry lost 3,000 jobs last month, helping to drag down the overall manufacturing sector, which added 1,000 jobs in March. \nWhen February’s jobs report was released, Trump touted the then 10,000-job gain in manufacturing (which was revised down to 9,000 jobs) as a sign that his on-and-off tariff proposals were working. (However, it’s important to note that monthly economic data can be quite volatile and that the jobs report can be a “slow burn” reflection of changes in the economy). \nFed remains in wait-and-see mode \nAverage wages grew at a healthy 0.3% rate for the month and slowed to 3.8% for the year; however, that “yields solid personal income gains for households,” Bostjancic noted. \nThe moderating but still solid wage gains coupled with expectations that next week’s Consumer Price Index will show a continued slowing of inflation could have been seen as a “Goldilocks” report, Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \n“Instead, today’s news does seem a little dated, but at least it’s good news that hiring wasn’t already weakening before the turbulence caused by the shock from trade policy,” he wrote. \nFriday’s jobs data is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines, Feroli noted. \nTrump called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell Friday to cut interest rates — a demand the president has made a number of times of his hand-picked central bank leader with whom he has had a falling out. \nPowell said Friday the Fed is in no rush to make any move, despite Trump’s historic tariff increase. \n“Our macroeconomists are all working hard to, you know, to kind of digest the news of this week and try to filter that into the forecast that they’ll make, and policymakers are doing very much the same thing,” Powell said at a conference in Arlington, Virginia. “I will say, though, it feels like we don’t need to be in a hurry.” \nCNN’s John Towfighi and David Goldman contributed reporting. \nCNN \nCNN \nCNN \nClipped From Video",

Credits: Inditex.Inditex has announced a new scholarship programme in collaboration with the Asian University for Women (AUW), aimed at facilitating access to higher education for workers from supplier factories in Bangladesh, one of the most important countries in its global production chain.\n\nIn a country where access to university for women continues to be a privilege, the initiative seeks to offer 50 workers the possibility of pursuing pre-university and university studies over the next five years.\n\nWith an investment of 3.75 million euros, the programme will cover tuition, accommodation and maintenance, and will be managed by the AUW, which will directly organise entrance exams and interviews at the workplace.\n\nOscar Maceiras at the Asian University for Women with Rubana Huq, Vice Chancellor of AUW. Credits: Inditex.Women have silently sustained the foundations of the global fashion industry for decades. In countries like Bangladesh, they represent more than 80 percent of the workforce in textile factories. They are, in effect, the true gear that keeps the fashion system running, although they are rarely recognised as such.\n\n“At Inditex, we believe that empowering women through education is one of the most effective ways to generate positive and lasting change in these communities,” said Inditex CEO Óscar García Maceiras, during his conference at the Asian University for Women.\n\nFrom the AUW, its rector Cherie Blair highlighted the transformative potential of education: “As the first in my family to enter university, I know how powerful higher education can be to open doors that would otherwise be unimaginable.”\n\nThis article was translated to English using an AI tool.FashionUnited uses AI language tools to speed up translating (news) articles and proofread the translations to improve the end result.

               "site_type": "news",
               "text": " Company finances are the hidden, beating heart of a business. Suppliers and workers don’t see the behind-the-scenes details of how they get paid, just that the money flows into their bank accounts (or, increasingly, digital wallets). \nBut as enterprises increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to help them manage their financial operations, it’s turning the rapidly evolving technology into the equivalent of a corporate pacemaker, automating and regulating the smooth flow of billions of dollars in disbursements. \nIn the process, AI is becoming a profit center that helps businesses streamline their payment processes, ensure disbursements flow on time — and in the right amount — and better manage their capital. \nA forthcoming report titled “Smart Spending: How AI is Transforming Financial Decision Making,” a collaboration between PYMNTS Intelligence and Coupa, finds that more than eight in 10 CFOs at large companies are either already using AI or considering adopting it for a core financial function: accounts payable, or the process by which companies pay their suppliers, vendors and contractors. \nThe trend is particularly pronounced among the biggest enterprises, with 75% of companies earning more than $10 billion annually having already blended AI into their payment processes. Imagine payment processes flowing seamlessly, expenditures laid bare with new clarity and operational efficiency improving — just like an elite athlete with a pacemaker. \nWhat exactly does AI do in the realm of accounts payable? \nFor one, it can assist in managing payment terms and optimizing a company’s working capital. Those improvements in turn can fuel enhanced visibility into a balance sheet and smarter spending decisions. More than two in three enterprise CFOs are willing to invest in AI solutions that provide real-time visibility into expenditures, a sign of the fundamental shift that AI is driving in financial management. \nThe report, which publishes on Friday (April 11), shows how CFOs increasingly recognize the power of AI not just to streamline one of their most important and routine functions but also to boost their margins. \nBut the path to integrating AI into an existing accounts payable system is notoriously bumpy. \nNearly two-thirds of CFOs report difficulties in making the different systems work together seamlessly. Another hurdle is the lack of customization offered by some AI tools, making it hard for companies to tailor the technology to their specific needs. \nFor service-based businesses, high upfront implementation costs can also be a major concern. Additionally, companies with complex operations or those spanning multiple regions may find it challenging to implement AI due to varying local regulations. In some instances, particularly in the technology sector, there are concerns about whether AI-generated results are always consistent or replicable, which can affect trust in automated decision-making. Call it AI’s heart arrhythmia. \nDespite these challenges, the demand for AI solutions in financial management is growing. \nCFOs are increasingly willing to invest in AI tools that offer real-time visibility into expenditures, with 68% indicating a willingness to pay for this capability. There is also significant interest in AI that can support vendor negotiations, optimize budgets, detect fraud and provide predictive analytics. The report details how this willingness to invest in AI reflects a growing recognition of the technology’s potential to transform financial operations and create a new competitive edge. \n•   AI is being widely adopted in accounts payable by large companies to automate processes and improve efficiency \n•   Companies are experiencing tangible benefits from AI adoption including better visibility into spending, reduced payment errors and improved vendor relationships. \n•   Integrating AI into existing financial systems can be challenging due to compatibility issues, lack of customization and implementation costs. \n• There is a strong and growing demand for AI-powered financial tools that offer real-time spend tracking, budget optimization and predictive analytics, indicating a significant shift toward AI-driven financial management.",

               "text": "Trump has nevertheless turned up the heat on China by hiking the tariff rate on Chinese goods to 125% .\n”The collapse in commodities [prices] is a circuit breaker, a sign that a global recession is afoot,” said Marko Papic, a macro and geopolitical expert at BCA Research.\nChina is the largest consumer of commodities, and the higher-than-expected tariffs are likely to be a drag not only on the country’s growth, but also on its consumption of certain commodities, in particular energy and industrial metals.\nOf all the commodities in the basket, energy fell the most since April 2, declining around 12%, according to S&P Global’s GSCI energy gauge . \nIndustrial metals posted the second steepest loss of around 9%, followed by soft commodities, which fell roughly 5.2%, according to S&P’s Global.\nAs for oil, the wider negative sentiment also coincided with OPEC+’s recent decision to accelerate the pace of the group’s production increases . OPEC+ sped up pace of hikes, but increases had been previously decided. Oil prices are still at multi-year lows despite the slight rebound following Trump’s tariff U-turn, with global benchmark Brent around $64.78 a barrel and the U.S. West Texas Intermediate at $61.77 per barrel. Oil prices are sensitive to the trade escalation, given China’s status as the largest crude importer and the fact that crude commodities are denominated in the U.S. dollar.\nGoldman Sachs slashed its oil price forecast for both crude benchmarks to $62 per barrel for Brent and $58 per barrel for WTI by the end of the year.\nGlobal recession fears mount\nExpectations of further declines in commodities prices are feeding a growing chorus of U.S. recession calls. JPMorgan expects U.S. gross domestic product to contract 0.3% this year, after a robust year for growth.\n”The broader move lower we’ve seen in crude oil since 2 April suggests the market is pricing in bigger odds of a recession,” ING’s commodities strategists said.\n”Commodity prices are being hammered by fast deteriorating sentiment as global recession fears mount amid escalating trade and geopolitical tensions,” said Sabrin Chowdhury, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions’ research unit BMI. She added that the probability of the U.S. falling into recession is now more than 50%.\nIndustrial metals also continue to suffer as trade tensions and recession fears compound with mainland China’s bleak property sector outlook, she added. \nCopper in particular is a leading indicator of economic health, given its use in many sectors. While copper futures in New York rallied on Wednesday, they are currently trading at $8,380 per ton on the NYMEX, marking an over 16% decline since April 2, data from FactSet showed.\nMetal markets are likely to remain pressured as China, the world’s largest consumer of copper , increasingly comes under the spotlight.\n”With growth in the U.S. likely to slow on the back of tariffs and China already struggling to revive its economy, demand for copper and other industrial metals is likely to weaken,” said Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING.\nSimilarly, Goldman Sachs cut its price forecast for copper, citing a surplus of the metal and its forecast of a stagnant U.S. economy.\n”We expect a hit to ex-China demand from weaker GDP growth, as well as a lower 2024 base for China demand than previously forecast,” the investment bank wrote in a note. \nIn the event of a U.S. recession, Goldman Sachs forecasts copper prices could fall even further to the lows seen in the trade war in Trump’s first term and the Covid-19 pandemic, at $6,500 and $5,900 per ton, respectively.",

(«Abcourt» ou la «Société») (TSX Venture: ABI) (OTCQB: ABMBF) est heureuse d’annoncer un financement par dette de 8 millions de dollars américains en vue de financer la relance de sa mine et de son usine Géant Dormant. \nUne entente de principe non-contraignante intervenue entre Abcourt et Nebari Natural Resources Credit Fund II, LP (« Nebari ») le 9 avril 2025 prévoit un financement garanti de 8 millions de dollars américains (environ 11 millions de dollars canadiens) (le «financement ») portant intérêt au taux de financement garanti à un jour (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus 12 %, avec une durée de 36 mois. Le financement est conditionnel à la réalisation d’un financement concurrent de 6 millions de dollars américains (environ 8,5 millions de dollars canadiens), en équité et/ou de dette subordonnée, à une revue diligente standard et à la signature de documents définitifs. \n« Ce financement, conjugué au financement en équité, fournira le capital nécessaire pour relancer la mine et l’usine Géant Dormant, conformément à notre plan interne détaillé de la mine », a déclaré Pascal Hamelin, président et chef de la direction. « Une fois ces financements clôturés, avec les liquidités existantes, nous prévoyons que la société sera bien positionnée pour relancer et intensifier les opérations de la mine et de l’usine, y compris les besoins en fonds de roulement et les exigences corporatives. » \n« Nous avons travaillé en étroite collaboration avec nos partenaires pour compléter le financement requis qui couvre le solde du capital nécessaire pour Géant Dormant, tel qu’estimé actuellement dans notre plan interne détaillé de la mine, tout en préservant un potentiel de hausse significatif pour les actionnaires d’Abcourt. » \nAugmentation du financement en équité \nLa Société est également heureuse d’annoncer qu’elle a augmenté la taille de son placement privé sans intermédiaire précédemment annoncé, consistant en la vente de toute combinaison de : \n * 170 000 000 d’unités de la Société (les « unités») au prix de 0,05 $ CA l’unité; et \n * 141 666 667 actions ordinaires de la Société qui sont admissibles à titre d’«actions accréditives» au sens du paragraphe 66(15) de la Loi de l’impôt sur le revenu (Canada) et de l’article 359.1 de la Loi sur les impôts (Québec) (chacune, une «action accréditive») au prix de 0,06 $ CA l’action accréditive ; pour un produit brut pouvant atteindre 8 500 000 $ CA (le « placement privé »), dont un montant de 1 668 040 $ CA a été levé à ce jour (voir le communiqué de presse d’Abcourt du 3 avril 2025). \nChaque unité sera composée d’une action ordinaire de la Société (une « action ordinaire ») et d’un bon de souscription d’action ordinaire (un « bon de souscription »). Chaque bon de souscription permettra à son détenteur d’acheter une action ordinaire au prix de 0,08 $ CA pour une période de 36 mois suivant la date de clôture du placement privé (la « date de clôture »). \nDans l’éventualité où, durant la période comprise entre 12 mois et 36 mois suivant la date de clôture, le prix de négociation moyen pondéré en fonction du volume des actions ordinaires dépasse 0,12 $ CA par action ordinaire pendant une période de 20 jours de bourse consécutifs, la Société pourra, à son gré, après cette période de 20 jours, accélérer la date d’échéance des bons de souscription en envoyant un avis aux porteurs inscrits (un « avis d’accélération ») et en publiant un communiqué de presse (un « communiqué d’accélération des bons de souscription »).

Trump’s tariffs include 104% on products from China, 20% on the European Union, 24% on Japan and 25% on South Korea.

               "site_type": "blog",
               "text": "3D body measurement by Hohenstein. Credits: Hohenstein Institut / SizekickThe global testing and research institute Hohenstein has acquired shares in Global Textile Scheme GmbH (GTS). With this move, Hohenstein aims to support GTS in automating data exchange along the entire supply chain, the company announced in a press release.\n\nGTS enables automated data exchange between suppliers, manufacturers, brands, and retailers. The company develops and establishes an international standard for handling structured product data in the textile and apparel industry as part of the GTS Industry Initiative. The goal of the strategic partnership with Hohenstein is to harmonise and automate data exchange along the entire supply chain, from fibre to recycling, thereby laying the foundation for a circular economy.\n\n”The demand for reliable, structured, and machine-readable data along the textile value chain is growing rapidly,” explains Dr. Stefan Droste, CEO of Hohenstein. ”We want to support our clients in this process and are committed to close collaboration with GTS.”\n\n”The Global Textile Scheme initiative offers a pragmatic solution for efficiently managing complex data, without excessively increasing manual processes,” emphasises Droste. ”Data is becoming the backbone of the circular economy, and we are excited to actively shape this development together with GTS.”\n\nDATA INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FOR THE FASHION INDUSTRY\nData is becoming increasingly important, especially in light of new regulations, such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP), the Hohenstein press release underscores. In collaboration with GTS, the company aims to provide businesses with access to standardised data structures, which is crucial for recycling, circularity, and more sustainable production.\n\nHohenstein has built an extensive database through the Hohenstein Institute. Recently, Hohenstein partnered with the Munich-based startup Sizekick to develop deep learning models for accurate size recommendations. This could reduce return rates in e-commerce.\n\nThis article was translated to English using an AI tool.FashionUnited uses AI language tools to speed up translating (news) articles and proofread the translations to improve the end result.

               "title": "Philippines Used Car Finance Market Outlook Report 2025-2028 | NBFCs Lead Philippines' Used Car Finance Market Amid Growing Demand for Affordable Mobility",
               "site_type": "news",
               "text": "Dublin, April  10, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ”Philippines Used Car Finance Market Outlook to 2028” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.\nThe Philippines’ used car finance market is valued at PHP 270 billion, driven by increasing demand for affordable vehicle ownership and the availability of flexible financing options. Rising urbanization, combined with a growing middle class, has fueled the demand for used cars as an economical choice over new vehicles. Financial institutions and online platforms offering competitive loan rates and simplified application processes further bolster the market.\nMetro Manila and Cebu dominate the Philippines’ used car finance market due to their economic activity and high vehicle density. Metro Manila leads as the financial hub with concentrated banking services and consumer markets. Cebu, being a significant business center outside Luzon, shows robust demand due to its growing population and accessibility to organized vehicle trading channels.\nThe Philippine government has implemented the National Air Quality Monitoring Program to address environmental concerns. This program involves monitoring air pollutants and enforcing regulations to reduce emissions. For the automotive sector, this means stricter emission standards for vehicles, impacting the used car market by necessitating compliance and potentially influencing consumer choices towards environmentally friendly options.\nPhilippines Used Car Finance Market Segmentation\nBy Lender Category: The market is segmented into NBFCs, banks, and captives. NBFCs dominate the market due to their streamlined processes, faster loan disbursement, and competitive interest rates compared to traditional banks. Their ability to cater to a broader range of borrowers, including those with limited credit history, makes them a preferred choice among consumers, particularly in semi-urban and urban areas.\nBy Loan Tenure: Loan tenure in the market is segmented into less than 12 months, 12 to 24 months, 24 to 36 months, and more than 36 months. The 24 to 36 months category dominates as it strikes a balance between affordable monthly installments and a manageable repayment period. Borrowers often prefer this tenure as it minimizes financial strain without significantly increasing the overall interest burden.\nPhilippines Used Car Finance Market Competitive Landscape\nThe Philippines used car finance market is dominated by major players offering competitive interest rates, simplified loan processes, and extensive vehicle inventories. The sector also sees increased collaboration between financial institutions and online platforms to attract tech-savvy consumers.\nPhilippines Used Car Finance Market Analysis\nGrowth Drivers\nIncreasing Purchasing Power: The Philippines has experienced a notable rise in disposable incomes, contributing to higher consumer spending. In 2022, the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita reached around USD 3,499, reflecting improved economic conditions. This economic growth has enabled more individuals to afford vehicles, thereby boosting the used car finance market. Additionally, the unemployment rate stood at 2.23% in 2023, indicating a stable labor market that supports consumer purchasing power.\nEasy Availability of Finance: The expansion of financial services in the Philippines has made vehicle financing more accessible. The auto finance market has shown robust performance, reflecting a strong recovery and growth phase for the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This increased availability of financing options has facilitated higher vehicle ownership rates, particularly in the used car segment. Financial institutions now offer flexible loan terms, including lower interest rates and extended repayment periods, further encouraging vehicle purchases.\nRise in Urbanization Rates: Urbanization in the Philippines has been a significant growth driver for the used car finance market. By 2024, the urban population reached around 56.4 million, accounting for 48.5% of the total population, according to World Bank data. The shift toward urban living has increased demand for personal vehicles as public transportation struggles to meet the needs of growing urban centers. Additionally, cities like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao have seen higher vehicular density, with used car ownership rising as individuals seek affordable mobility options. Financial institutions have capitalized on this trend by offering tailored auto finance solutions for urban customers.\nChallenges\nHigh Upfront Financial Barriers: Despite the availability of vehicle financing options, the upfront costs associated with acquiring a used car remain a significant obstacle for many Filipinos. Down payments and initial fees can be a financial burden, especially for individuals in lower income brackets. This limits access to vehicle ownership for a considerable segment of the population, creating challenges for market expansion and inclusivity.\nQuality Assurance and Verification Challenges: The used car market in the Philippines faces hurdles in ensuring the quality and reliability of vehicles. Limited availability of standardized inspection processes and certification systems affects consumer trust. Additionally, the lack of a centralized vehicle history database complicates verification processes, increasing risks for both buyers and financing institutions.\nPhilippines Used Car Finance Future Outlook\nOver the next five years, the Philippines’ used car finance market is expected to experience substantial growth, reaching a market size of PHP 435 Bn in 2028, driven by increasing digitalization, higher car ownership aspirations, and expanded financial inclusion efforts. The emergence of innovative fintech solutions is also anticipated to improve accessibility to loans for lower-income segments, creating new opportunities.\nFuture Market Opportunities\nDigital Transformation in Used Car Financing: The integration of digital platforms is reshaping the used car market in the Philippines. By 2024, the number of internet users in the country reached over 86.9 million, with a penetration rate of around 73%, according to World Bank data. This widespread digital connectivity has enabled the proliferation of online marketplaces and financing platforms, offering consumers easy access to vehicle listings and seamless loan applications.\nUnlocking Rural Market Potential: Despite urban areas like Metro Manila driving much of the vehicle demand, rural regions of the Philippines remain underpenetrated markets for used car financing. As of 2023, rural areas accounted for nearly 51.71% of the population, with infrastructure projects under the ”Build, Build, Build” program improving connectivity across provinces. The government’s increased investment in rural internet access has also helped bridge the digital divide, enabling more people to explore financing options online.\nCompany Coverage Includes:\nLeague One Finance & Leasing Corp.\nGlobal Dominion Financing Inc.\n2.

               "text": " The British Business Bank has agreed a new facility with BFS Marine Finance, designed to increase the flow of finance to smaller businesses within the commercial marine sector. \nThe structured finance facility of up to £20m will “allow BFS Marine Finance to provide secured financing facilities for the acquisition or refurbishment of marine assets operating in various sectors.” \nQualifying assets include coastal ships trading “in UK and European waters, general purpose workboats, windfarm service craft, survey vessels, charter boats and passenger ferries.” \nThe finance will enable smaller marine businesses to “acquire newer vessels to expand or upgrade their existing fleet.” \nIt will contribute to improved energy efficiency as the “use of more sustainable fuels or conversion to battery or hybrid power comes online.” \nJonathan Marriott, Senior Director, Structured Financial Institutions Solutions, British Business Bank, said: \n“Marine finance is a sector with strong growth potential in the UK and we are delighted to be supporting BFS Marine Finance in unlocking that growth for smaller businesses within it. Historically, the sector has had a high barrier to entry and a limited number of lenders servicing the market, so we hope this transaction will allow BFS Marine Finance to support more businesses and help drive availability and competition in the process.” \nThey added: \n“BFS Marine Finance is part of Bibby Financial Services (BFS), a subsidiary of The Bibby Line Group, one of the UK’s oldest family-owned businesses, with a strong heritage in shipping and financial services.” \nPaul Ratcliffe, Managing Director of BFS Marine Finance said: \n“BFS Marine Finance combines BFS’s financing specialism with Bibby Line Group’s shipping heritage to grow our support for UK businesses. We are delighted to work with the British Business Bank and look forward to helping businesses acquire vessels to expand or upgrade existing fleets in 2025 and beyond.” \nAndy Stalmanis, Treasurer of Bibby Financial Services, added: \n“This transaction will undoubtedly enable us to help UK marine sector businesses grow and thrive, and we look forward to continuing to build a strong relationship with the British Business Bank.” \nAs noted in the update, The British Business Bank is the UK government’s economic development bank. \nEstablished in November 2014, its mission is to drive sustainable growth and prosperity across the UK and to “enable the transition to a net zero economy, by improving access to finance for smaller businesses.” \nIts remit is to design, deliver and efficiently manage UK-wide smaller business access “to finance programs for the UK government.”",

               "text": " BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s economy is likely to stagnate at best in 2025 after shrinking for two years and the impact of U.S. tariffs could weigh down an already unimpressive showing, leading think tanks forecast Thursday. \nGermany has Europe’s biggest economy and is the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member. Five economic institutes said in a regular update that they expect minimal growth of 0.1% this year — down from the 0.8% they forecast in September. They predicted growth of 1.3% in 2026. \nHowever, they pointed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s trade policy. U.S. tariffs on aluminum, steel and vehicle imports are likely to reduce German economic growth this year and next by 0.1 percentage points each, according to their report. \nThe sweeping tariffs announced last week by President Donald Trump and then largely put on hold could double that hit to gross domestic product, the economists said. But the added that “the specific effects are difficult to quantify, as tariff rates have never been raised so sharply in the world’s current globalized economy.” \nGermany’s prospective new government, which hopes to take office next month after months of political drift in the country, aims to revitalize the economy. Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor, and his would-be allies presented their coalition agreement on Wednesday. \nLET THE NEWS COME TO YOU \nGet any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more. \nExplore newsletters",

               "text": "Inflation Unexpectedly Fell In March Before Tariffs Worked Through the Economy\nBy\nFull Bio\nDiccon Hyatt is an experienced financial and economics reporter who has covered the pandemic-era economy in hundreds of stories over the past two years. He’s written hundreds of stories breaking down complex financial topics in plainspoken language, emphasizing the impact that economic currents would have on individuals’ finances and the market. He’s also worked at U.S. 1, Community News Service and the Middletown Transcript.\nLearn about our editorial policies\nPublished April 10, 2025\nKey Takeaways\nConsumer prices unexpectedly fell in March, the biggest drop since 2020, as gas prices fell.\nFalling gas prices outweighed rising grocery costs, driving overall inflation to its lowest annual increase since September.\nInflation has yet to be impacted by Trump’s campaign of tariffs against trading partners, which economists predict will push up the cost of living in the coming months.\nThe first bites of Trump’s renewed trade wars could show up in May’s inflation data, one economist said.\nMarch was the best month for consumer prices in nearly five years, as falling gas prices helped out household budgets despite increases for other necessities.\nConsumer prices fell 0.1% in March, according to the Consumer Price Index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. Gas prices fell, contributing to a fall in overall inflation. Falling gas prices outweighed a jump in food costs: Groceries got 0.5% more expensive in March.\nThe overall CPI rose 2.4% over the year, its lowest annual increase since September. Forecasters had expected a 2.6% annual increase, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. ”Core” inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.1% over the month, making for a 2.8% increase over the year. Falling car insurance and airline ticket prices helped keep core inflation running cooler than expected: the median forecast called for 3% year-over-year core inflation.\nThe report showed consumer prices were headed in the right direction in March despite several of President Donald Trump’s tariffs having taken effect that month. Some tariffs against Canada and Mexico went into effect in March , and there was a 20% increase in tariffs against China. Since then, Trump has hiked tariffs against China to 125%, imposed a 25% tariff on auto imports, and implemented a global 10% tariff against products from nearly every country in the world. Economists expect those import taxes to push up consumer prices in the coming months, potentially stoking inflation.\n”This report could be like reading an old newspaper from a different reality,”  David Russell, head of market strategy at online brokerage firm TradeStation, wrote in a commentary.\nA drop in consumer prices would normally be music to the ears of Federal Reserve policymakers, who adjust the nation’s monetary policy to keep inflation running at an annual rate of around 2%. Fed officials have held their benchmark fed funds rate at a higher-than-usual level in recent months in an effort to extinguish the last embers of the post-pandemic burst of high inflation.\nFed officials anticipate lowering their key fed funds rate, which influences interest rates on all kinds of loans, in response to falling inflation. However, Trump’s tariff campaign could make them reluctant to do so. Fed officials have said they’ll stay in ”wait and see” mode until the impact of the tariffs becomes clear.\n”March’s inflation data is encouraging but will do little to calm nerves at the Federal Reserve as they wait to parse through the effects of dramatic changes in U.S. trade policy,” Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a commentary.\nWhen Will Government Data Show Tariff Impact?\nAlthough tariffs were in effect in March, it may take a while before they show up in price tags and inflation data if past trade wars are anything to go by.\nIn 2018, when Trump raised tariffs on washing machines, it took three months for the import taxes to be passed on to consumers, Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a commentary.\n”This suggests May is the earliest that the CPI data will start to pick up in response to the tariffs,” Tombs wrote.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?
