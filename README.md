# Capital - Personal Finance Tracker

Capital is a comprehensive personal finance management application designed to help users track their finances, manage budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits and the broader economic landscape. It features a clean React frontend and a robust Express.js backend connected to a PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker for ease of deployment and development.

## Features

* **Dashboard:** A central hub displaying:
   * Current economic news articles.
   * Key economic indicators (GDP, Inflation, Unemployment, etc.).
   * Stock market trends (Top Gainers, Losers, Most Active).
   * Personalized account balance trends.
   * Yearly budget performance overview.
* **Accounts:** Manage various financial accounts (Checking, Savings, Credit Card, etc.), track balances, and view associated transactions.
* **Budgets:** Create and manage monthly budgets for income and expense categories, track spending against goals and visualize progress.
* **Transactions:** Add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions, assigning them to specific accounts and budget categories.
* **Settings:**
   * Update user profile information (name, email, birthday).
   * Manage account security settings (password change).
   * Export personal financial data.
   * Delete user account and associated data.
   * Logout functionality.

## Technologies

* **Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Material UI, TanStack Query, Vite
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Caching:** Redis
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Argon2 (Password Hashing)
* **Other Libraries:** Zod (Validation), Winston (Logging), Helmet (Security), CORS, Express Rate Limit, etc.

```

* **`client/`**: Contains all the code for the React user interface.
* **`server/`**: Holds the Express.js backend, including API logic, database interactions, and services.
* **`types/`**: Shared TypeScript definitions and Zod schemas used by both frontend and backend for type safety and data validation.
* **`docker-compose.yaml`**: Defines the services (application, database, cache) and their configurations for Docker.
* **`package.json` (root)**: Manages installation and running of both client and server concurrently.
* **`server/schema.sql`**: SQL script to initialize the PostgreSQL database structure.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js (check `.nvmrc` or choose a recent LTS version)
    * npm
    * Docker & Docker Compose
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeffrey-cordero/capital
    cd capital
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    * Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file (Database credentials, Session Secret, API Keys if using external data features, Client/Server URLs).
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Run the root installation script which installs dependencies for the `server`, `client`, and `types` workspaces.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Database Setup:**
    * The `docker-compose.yaml` configuration will automatically initialize the PostgreSQL database using the `server/schema.sql` file when the container starts for the first time.

## Development

There are two main ways to run the application locally:

1.  **Using Docker Compose (Recommended):**
    * This method starts the application (React and Express), PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache in separate containers.
    * Ensure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose) is running.
    * From the root `capital/` directory:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    * The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` for `VITE_SERVER_PORT`).
    * The backend API will be running on port `8000` (or the port specified in your `.env` for `PORT`).

2.  **Using npm Scripts (Manual Start):**
    * This requires manually starting the database and Redis instances if not already running (e.g., via Docker Desktop or separate installations).
    * Use the concurrent script from the root `package.json` to start both client and server development servers:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * Alternatively, start them separately:
        ```bash
        # In one terminal (from the root directory)
        npm run server:dev

        # In another terminal (from the root directory)
        npm run client:dev
        ```
    * For production builds/starts:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        npm run start
        ```

## Testing

- Playwright end-to-end testing requires disabling rate limiting within `server/.env`

## Future Roadmap

Potential features and improvements for future development:

* **Pagination:** Implement pagination for transaction lists and potentially accounts/budgets.
* **Multi-Select Categories:** Allow assigning transactions to multiple budget categories.
* **Import/Export:** Add functionality to import/export transactions from/to CSV/OFX files, potentially with a helper modal for mapping fields.
* **Recurring Transactions:** Add support for scheduling recurring income and expenses.
* **Goal Tracking:** Implement features for setting and tracking specific financial goals (e.g., saving for a down payment).
* **AI Agent Integration:** Explore integrating an AI agent for financial insights, advice, or automated categorization.
* **Live Data Feeds:** Integrate real-time stock market and news feeds instead of periodic fetching.
* **Bank API Syncing:** Connect directly to bank APIs (e.g., Plaid) to automatically import accounts and transactions.
